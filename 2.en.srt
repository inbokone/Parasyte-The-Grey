WEBVTT

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:20.812
Mister, that's rare, okay?
It's a limited edition.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:25.859
But this is pretty old.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.654
I'll give you 1.5 million won.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.365
- Did you say 1.5 million?
- Yeah.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.827
Oh, jeez.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.248
Sure, I'll take that offer.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.297
Here's one million won first.

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.803
And here's the other 500,000 won.

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.724
This isn't the same town
I lived in as a kid.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:58.683
What?

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.019
I'm saying this town has changed.

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:04.064
Who wears this kind of watch these days?

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.774
That watch is a fake.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:07.108
What?

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:28.755
The line doesn't work.
Can you reconnect it?

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:29.798
Yes, of course.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.050
Oh, wait. There is a balance due.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.343
It'll be 80,000 won.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.013
Here you go.

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:40.100
Please take care of it quickly.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.226
Sure thing.

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.417
Mister, are you tossing this out?

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:09.087
Everything here is for sale.
Why would I throw that...

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:13.007
It just needs a new belt. That's all.

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:19.597
What?

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.559
- Why are you staring at me?
- What?

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.394
Smoking's not allowed?

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:26.938
No, it isn't, but go ahead.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:29.774
How much with a new belt?

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.568
For this,

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:34.154
I'll give it to you for 350,000 won.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.241
- Everyone's a goddamn crook in this town.
- What?

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:43.121
- Just toss it my way for 200,000 won.
- No way.

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:46.166
Changing the belt on this alone
would cost 160,000 won.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.458
- No way.
- Okay, fine.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.420
I'll go get my cell phone switched on.
Have it ready.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.381
Sure. You have to come back, okay?

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.602
- Is my cell phone ready?
- Yes, it's all done.

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.020
Here you go.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.106 line:20%
KANG-WOO'S FRIEND KI-SEOK

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:15.653
<i>- The person you have...</i>
- Excuse me.

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:20.825
Some people have been looking for you
since this morning.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.579
They were asking about you,
showing your picture.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.125
Okay, thank you. Here's a tip.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.543
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.088
Sir, is my motorcycle ready?

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.299
Man, you haven't even started on it.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:37.842
You're back already?

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:39.219
Get started. I'm busy.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.679
Well, the parts are on their way
as we speak.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.187
Fuck. You already ratted me out?

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:50.521
Sorry.

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:52.190
Hey, Seol Kang-woo!

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.151
Oh, no! Don't break that!

00:04:24.722 --> 00:04:25.890
Come here, you bastard!

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.852
Hey! Get the car!

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.417
Get out of the way!

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.584
Everyone, move!

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.007
- That bastard's right there!
- Go get him!

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:00.508
Get him!

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.595
- Come here.
- You asshole!

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.180
Don't let him get away!

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:12.061
Get him!

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:14.439
Hurry up and catch him!

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:17.734
Hurry up!

00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:19.902
Hey, you bastard!

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.073
Fuck!

00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:25.074
Open this gate!

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:27.535
- You son of a bitch!
- Hurry up and go around!

00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:40.131
Hey! Hey!

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:43.760
You got something to say?

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:07.992
I did food delivery for years
in this town, you damn morons.

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:10.578
Jeez.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.257
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Kyu-min, it's me.

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:25.385
<i>Oh, Kang-woo. Where are you? You okay?</i>

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.428
Why are the Yeongdeungpo guys
moving so fast?

00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:29.847
<i>Jeez, Kang-woo, where are you?
Did something happen?</i>

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:33.393
I mean, they came in two big vans
filled with their men to catch me.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.769
<i>Oh my. Really?</i>

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.896
I just don't think I can stay here.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:39.315
I'm gonna go somewhere else,
so send me some money.

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.734
<i>Jeez, as if money is all you need?</i>

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:44.445
<i>You'll need things like a car,
so I'll just come to you.</i>

00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:46.239
Okay. Hey, thanks.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.198
What about Jong-do?

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:50.618
<i>He's worried sick about you,
saying he had you do something pointless.</i>

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:52.286
<i>Don't worry about us over here.</i>

00:06:52.286 --> 00:06:54.747
<i>Just tell me where you are.
I'll head over right now.</i>

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:58.292
No, I can't meet you now.
Let's meet up tonight.

00:06:58.292 --> 00:06:59.794
I have business to take care of.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.921
<i>Didn't you say
those goons were on your tail?</i>

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.382
I have something more important,
you asshole.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.884
<i>- No need to curse at me.
- </i>  Let's meet tonight at 9 p.m.

00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:08.678
- <i>Sure.</i>
- I'll send you an address.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.596
<i>Okay. Take care of yourself.</i>

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:12.223
I will. Save my number, okay?

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.683
<i>Will do. See you later.</i>

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:23.109
Little sis, where are you?

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.708
SAEJIN

PARASYTE: THE GREY

00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.126
Good work, everyone.

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:23.794
- I'm from Team 3.
- Go ahead, sir.

00:08:23.794 --> 00:08:25.129
I'm going in, then.

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:39.769
Oh, hello.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.315
Thank you, Detective. I will take them.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.566
Oh, no. It's okay.

00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:46.901
Is Captain Choi here?

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.486
She's inside.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:49.403
Oh, I see.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.208
Hello, Captain.
Thank you for all of your hard work.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.292
Oh, sure.

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:06.671
These are the recent case files
that you requested.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:07.838
Thank you, Detective.

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:10.716
I'm Sergeant Kang Won-seok.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.219
Thank you, Sergeant Kang Won-seok.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.763
You know, we could've reviewed
these files ourselves.

00:09:15.763 --> 00:09:17.098
It's better if we review them

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:20.059
since we've seen
a lot of parasite-related cases.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:21.894
Right, that's true.

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:26.482
Is there something you want to say to me?

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:27.733
Oh, right.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.820
Well, Captain, to be honest, I...

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.991
PROFESSOR CHOI JUN-KYUNG'S
CRIMINAL PROFILING

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.451
I'm a fan of yours.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:42.039
You're the top profiler in Korea
and a professor at the police academy.

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:45.793
If you don't mind,
could you please autograph this for me?

00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:48.379
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.006
Oh, thank you so much.

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.175
You're really amazing.

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:55.761
As a professor,
you could just live a comfortable life,

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.680
but you're out working in the field.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.849
- I truly admire you.
- It's nothing.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.643
I just think I should do
something beneficial for humanity.

00:10:03.227 --> 00:10:05.479
Oh, something beneficial for humanity?

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:09.317
By the way, how does one become
a member of Team Grey?

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.068
Excuse me?

00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:14.739
I also want to do something beneficial
and worthwhile for humanity.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:19.035
Well, I'm not sure.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:24.540
If you provide us with a lot of help
in finding the parasites,

00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:27.251
then I could speak to headquarters.

00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:29.128
Oh, really? Thank you so much.

00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:35.384
Seriously, even if it's something small,
if you need anything, please call me.

00:10:36.093 --> 00:10:37.094
My business card.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.805
- That's for you.
- Thank you.

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:42.224
- Right, I'll get going.
- Okay.

00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:46.395
Oh, for humankind. Let's go, Team Grey!

00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:49.690
Bye, then.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:11.045
CASE FILE: ATTEMPTED MURDER
OF SUPERMARKET CLERK

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:30.106
That'll be 5,500 won.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:33.526
Okay, I have to get this reimbursed,
so please give me a receipt.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.028
Mr. Chul-min!

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:37.571
When is your break?

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:40.700
It's in 15 minutes.

00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:43.536
I'll wait for you around the back.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.079
- Let's have a coffee.
- Okay.

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:58.676
She's unconscious.
But they say she's fine.

00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:01.595
Her clothes were also
heavily stained with her own blood.

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:03.806
That man stabbed me with a knife

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:06.392
and followed me,
but he just suddenly died?

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.189
- Mr. Chul-min.
- Hey.

00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:13.524
What brings you here?

00:12:14.608 --> 00:12:17.319
What do you mean?
I came to see you, you punk.

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:18.946
Really?

00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:20.614
You startled me.

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:22.408
Why startled?

00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:25.453
I was in the area, so I came by.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.383
Oh, wait a second.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:41.010
Stay still.

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:43.262
You have a gray hair here.

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.764
I don't have any gray hair.

00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:48.184
It's not a gray hair.

00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:50.269
My mistake.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.814
How's everything?

00:12:58.486 --> 00:12:59.320
Yeah?

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.074
Everything is fine. Every day is the same.

00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:06.744
That's good, then.

00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:10.748
But still, call me right away
if anything happens, okay?

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:13.292
And you feel okay?

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.045
Good.

00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:32.686
Do you know him?

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:35.397
No, I was just looking.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.402
How are your wife and son?

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:42.488
They're still in the Philippines.

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:44.740
My son is studying hard.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.910
Gosh, can you believe
they've been away for three years now?

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:52.706
I get bored, so call me
when you want to eat something delicious,

00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:55.835
not just when something happens, okay?

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.254
Or if something fun pops up
in your life, okay?

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.176
Thank you, Mr. Chul-min.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:13.602
You're back to "Thank you."
That's my cue to take my leave<i>.</i>

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:15.145
Gosh, then I'll be off.

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:17.439
No, I didn't mean it like that.

00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:18.357
Oh, right.

00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:20.442
Here.

00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:24.280
What is this?

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.074
A gift. Something to cheer you up.

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.785
Don't work too hard. Take it easy.

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:31.954
Bye.

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:22.421
SAEJIN CHURCH

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:40.356
The pastor wants to speak with you.

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:42.483
Enter the vehicle.

00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:52.785
I do not want to create a scene

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.371
with one of our own in public
with many humans around.

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:56.872
Get in quickly.

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:15.474
What are you up to, you monsters?

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:25.985
We need talented members of our own kin.

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.321
After possessing human brains,

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:33.075
all of us have refined our talents
to secure our survival.

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:36.745
I told the pastor that one of our kin
imitates human expressions well.

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:38.831
And he wanted to speak with you.

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:42.084
That is why we are taking you.

00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:03.188
SAEJIN CHURCH

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:09.361
It's that mutant.

00:17:10.904 --> 00:17:13.615
Goddamn it,
I told you not to go near the monsters.

00:17:13.615 --> 00:17:15.492
You don't freaking listen, do you?

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:21.081
And what's that?

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:31.842
KYU-MIN: I'M AT NAMCHEON GAS STATION
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.138
I'LL BE THERE SOON

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.917
It seems like everyone's here,
so I'll get started.

00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:08.712
This is one of our kin who fled

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.173
to our church five days ago.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:23.102
<i>There is a police organization
that hunts our kin.</i>

00:18:24.561 --> 00:18:27.231
<i>And one of our kin has been captured alive</i>

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:29.983
<i>by that organization.</i>

00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:37.491
<i>They are torturing him
and using him to hunt us down.</i>

00:18:38.992 --> 00:18:44.957
<i>It is only a matter of time
before that policewoman discovers us.</i>

00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:49.336
<i>We need a new plan.</i>

00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:54.007
<i>All of our kin</i>

00:18:55.467 --> 00:19:00.139
<i>will be terminated by that policewoman.</i>

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:14.069
A short while ago,
we came to Earth with one goal in mind.

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.157
To take over human brains.

00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:22.619
To take over human brains and eat humans.

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:24.580
We were born

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:27.374
with that simple command and instinct.

00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:33.505
Unfortunately, one of our kin carried out
that simple command upon his birth

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.382
but was shot to death

00:19:35.382 --> 00:19:37.926
while following that instinct
at a festival.

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:41.930
And his true form was exposed
to countless humans.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.224
Because of that event,

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.936
humans quickly proceeded
with their research on us.

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:53.442
Even before we questioned
our own existence,

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.112
humans were conducting research on us,

00:19:57.821 --> 00:19:59.156
chasing us,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.118
and using our fellow kin
in an attempt to slaughter us.

00:20:04.244 --> 00:20:05.078
And now,

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:09.041
I have been informed
that they have arrived in our city.

00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:45.364
We may feel
that humans are weaker than us.

00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:49.659
However, we have no choice
but to parasitize their bodies to live.

00:22:50.827 --> 00:22:51.661
But I think

00:22:52.662 --> 00:22:56.249
it was humans
that brought about our existence.

00:22:56.249 --> 00:22:57.292
That is because

00:22:58.085 --> 00:23:01.129
humans are very much like us.

00:23:02.672 --> 00:23:04.257
Humans also parasitize.

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:09.054
Humans parasitize an immense entity
called an organization.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:11.807
They parasitize the intangible entity,
an organization,

00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:13.767
and make sacrifices for it.

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:15.852
They do things we do not comprehend

00:23:15.852 --> 00:23:18.480
that have nothing to do
with their survival

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.816
out of loyalty to that organization.

00:23:24.986 --> 00:23:30.033
That is why humans are
more powerful than us.

00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:32.953
We cannot reproduce.

00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:35.288
Therefore, in order for us to survive,

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:39.668
we must create an organization
just as humans have.

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:43.088
And for the sake of that organization,

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:46.174
we must combine all of our talents.

00:23:48.885 --> 00:23:50.512
That is the only way for us

00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:54.516
to avoid being slaughtered by the humans

00:23:56.143 --> 00:23:57.727
and continue to survive.

00:25:45.752 --> 00:25:48.255
Die! Die! Just die!

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:01.601
A human has already come
within our vicinity.

00:26:05.313 --> 00:26:09.943
Use the talents you have honed
to kill him immediately.

00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:12.237
Okay, let us get started.

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:08.877
Man, enough already. We're tired too.

00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:11.796
Hey! Turn the car around!
We're all gonna die if we stay here!

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:14.090
What are you saying? Are you fucking nuts?

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.468
- Hold him down.
- Let go of me!

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:18.011
- What the hell?
- Let me go!

00:27:18.011 --> 00:27:19.471
Hey, let go of me!

00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:23.224
They're all monsters.

00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:27.520
Listen, folks. Just go home.
This is none of your business.

00:27:28.688 --> 00:27:31.399
Are you the intruders?

00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:33.485
Jeez. What the hell is she saying?

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:34.653
Get lost!

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:40.158
In any case,
we have no choice but to kill them all.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:44.954
Hey, old man.

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.707
Do you have some fancy-ass life insurance?

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:50.877
Oh shit!

00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:52.337
What was that?

00:27:52.962 --> 00:27:53.963
What the hell is that?

00:28:03.765 --> 00:28:04.599
What is that?

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:29.958
Shit!

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.298
What? You were the intruder?

00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:39.342
Where's Namcheon gas station? Tell me!

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:42.387
Not that way. Come this way!

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:03.575
There is one who escaped.

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:07.579
I will take care of him.
Take these men to the pantry.

00:29:18.381 --> 00:29:23.511
NAMCHEON GAS STATION

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:29.392
<i>The person you have called is unavailable.
Please try again later.</i>

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:33.438
Damn it. Why aren't they picking up?

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.362
- Kang-woo!
- Hey, Kyu-min!

00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:43.865
Give me the car key!

00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:45.158
- The car key?
- The car key!

00:29:45.992 --> 00:29:46.826
But...

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:00.924
What's going on?

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.510
Fuck, I don't know. Let's talk later.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.720
Who the hell is she? And what is all this?

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.097
Did something happen?
Was it the Yeongdeungpo guys?

00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:11.184
We have to call the police.

00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:13.561
Are you crazy? The police?
Are you out of your mind?

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:16.815
Stop! What the hell are you doing?

00:30:17.524 --> 00:30:20.026
No police, okay?
You can't fucking call the police.

00:30:21.694 --> 00:30:24.989
- Where are the Yeongdeungpo guys now?
- Those bastards are dead, damn it!

00:30:26.449 --> 00:30:28.660
Hey, how did they find me?

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.328
It's like someone tipped them off.

00:30:39.212 --> 00:30:40.880
- Die!
- You bastard!

00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:45.552
Fucking die!

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:02.986
You son of a bitch!

00:31:12.787 --> 00:31:13.705
It's following us!

00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:36.019
You're back. Hurry up and do something.

00:31:36.603 --> 00:31:37.437
Do something!

00:31:45.653 --> 00:31:46.946
Oh, for fuck's sake.

00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:53.054
Kyu-min.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.264
Hey, Kyu-min. Wake up!

00:32:57.558 --> 00:32:58.393
Hey.

00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:00.353
Can you get up?

00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:02.021
We have to get out.

00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:04.774
Fuck. You got duped
by the Yeongdeungpo guys.

00:33:04.774 --> 00:33:07.151
- Hey, can you free yourself?
- You're wrong.

00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:09.654
It wasn't the Yeongdeungpo guys.

00:33:10.613 --> 00:33:13.032
It was Jong-do, our boss,
who told me to kill you.

00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:16.035
Hey.

00:33:17.412 --> 00:33:18.621
What kind of crap is that?

00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:22.000
He sold you out to reconcile

00:33:22.792 --> 00:33:24.419
with the Yeongdeungpo guys.

00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:29.507
Listen, you have to stay alert.

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:42.437
Damn it.
Why is everyone trying to fuck me over?

00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:48.943
Let go!

00:33:59.662 --> 00:34:01.122
Are you not one of us?

00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:05.460
What are you?

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:08.004
Are you mixed? Mixed with a human?

00:34:09.672 --> 00:34:11.758
You are a threat to us.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.260
I must report you to the pastor.

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:35.698
If you carry out
complex maneuvers like flying,

00:34:36.657 --> 00:34:39.452
your combat capability
is reduced to practically zero.

00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:42.622
It's too late for you anyway.

00:34:43.372 --> 00:34:46.918
You are an enemy to our kin.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:48.544
And

00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:50.088
you are...

00:34:52.215 --> 00:34:53.216
evil.

00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:10.191
Let go!

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:11.901
I said let go!

00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:14.737
Let go, you fucking bastard! Let go!

00:35:14.737 --> 00:35:18.241
I'm not going to die.
I'm going to live, you son of a bitch!

00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:14.338
What are you doing?

00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:19.093
Do you want to die too?

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:21.345
Hurry up and grab my hand!

00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:27.602
You're gonna die too. No, I can't.

00:36:27.602 --> 00:36:29.478
Hurry up and grab my hand!

00:36:53.127 --> 00:36:55.671
This cohabitant is absolutely useless
for my survival.
