WEBVTT

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.222
SOMEONE LIVING ON EARTH
SUDDENLY HAD A THOUGHT

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:24.190
IF THE HUMAN POPULATION SHRANK
TO A HUNDREDTH OF ITS SIZE

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.818
WOULD THE POISON SPEWED
ALSO DECREASE BY THE SAME AMOUNT?

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.789
IF THE HUMAN POPULATION WAS CUT IN HALF

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.375
HOW MANY MORE FORESTS WOULD SURVIVE?

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.383
SOMEONE LIVING ON EARTH
SUDDENLY HAD A THOUGHT

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.969
WE MUST PROTECT
THE FUTURE OF ALL LIVING THINGS

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.391
What did you say, you motherfucker?

00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.601
Fuck. What bullshit!

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:02.062
Motherfuckers, you don't think
I can kill someone?

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.521
ENOUGH, OR YOU'LL MAKE HIM CRY

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:04.439
THEN KILL SOMEONE

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.356
Fuck.

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:06.566
HE HAS AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.152
Try me.

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.781
These fucking bastards.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:12.817
Jesus.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.863
Wake up. Why did you even come
if you were just going to sleep?

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.115
Come out and dance a little, okay?

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.868
Come on, get up!

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.495
Jeez, you're so lame.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.164
Whatever. Just sleep.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.499
Oh, hey.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.502
Hey! Did you sober up a bit? Yes?

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:30.705
PARASYTE: THE GREY

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.041
ONE HOUR AGO

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:36.961
What?

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:38.921
It's not working again.

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:40.631
One moment, please.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.186
Sir, it's not working again.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.812
God, this is driving me nuts.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:56.981
Do you need a bag?

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:02.153
Do you have a rewards card?
If not, that'll be 44,990 won.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:11.704
Sir, you need to get a price tag
for the meat at the meat counter.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:14.707
Sir.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:16.501
Sir!

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.134
You need to get a price tag for this
at the meat counter.

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:27.637
This is how they gave it to me.

00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:30.390
Please get a price tag
at the meat counter.

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:32.058
Not my problem.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.894
You can just get it yourselves, damn it.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.688
Well, the meat counter handles the meat.

00:06:37.688 --> 00:06:41.109
- Please go over there--
- Fuck! I said you go get it!

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:45.696
Why the hell are you motherfuckers
ordering a customer around?

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:58.459
Fuck. This is bullshit, seriously.

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.169
Should I just kill you all?

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.464
Fuck. I swear I'll just kill them all.

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:08.428
Next in line.

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:23.734
I'm heading out first.

00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:26.279
Okay. Good night, Su-in.
Thanks for your hard work.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.280
Thank you.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.242
Hey, good work today.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.572
Hey, you bitch.

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:53.908
What did you say to me earlier?

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.993
Say it again, you little bitch!

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.287
Come here, damn it!

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:06.254
Fuck! You fucking bitch!

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.134
Listen, you motherfuckers!

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:15.972
Do you really think I can't kill anyone?
You hear me?

00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:18.891
That bitch. I will kill you.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.893
Fuck. I'm going to kill you.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:24.522
Shit!

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.526
Hey, you think I won't kill you
if you hide?

00:09:29.777 --> 00:09:31.237
Just wait, you little bitch.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:34.740
Fuck.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:01.976
Hello?

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:04.812
I'm near the intersection
by the Namcheon power plant.

00:10:04.812 --> 00:10:06.647
I think there's been an accident here.

00:10:06.647 --> 00:10:09.150
I see a motorcycle knocked over.
Yes, and a car.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.617
Yes, I'll brief you first thing tomorrow.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.035
Yes, understood, sir.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.078
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:23.456
Jesus, I'm so sick of this.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.874
Jeez. Seriously.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:27.043
This is the third violent crime
of the day.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.128
When it rains, it pours. Where's Won-seok?

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:30.921
Detective Kang will be here soon too.

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:34.383
I mean, why is he always late
when something happens?

00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:35.718
So, who's the suspect?

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:37.136
His name is Lee Kyung-chun.

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:39.597
He is 43 years old
with two priors for violent crimes

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.182
and a history of schizophrenia.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.851
- Schizophrenia?
- Yes.

00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:48.064
It seems he had a minor dispute
with the victim at the supermarket.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.775
We've secured testimonies
from the other employees.

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.860
He followed the victim in his car,

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.404
then hit her
and threatened her with a weapon.

00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:56.864
Crazy bastard. And?

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.284
And?

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.078
The thing is...

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:02.995
Well,

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:07.291
he was following the victim with a weapon,
and then he died on the spot.

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.585
- From excessive bleeding.
- Who?

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:11.420
The suspect?

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.215
Yes, it seems that he was cut
with something sharp

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.966
from his chest to his face.

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:17.760
You said he followed her and hit her.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.805
- So, what are you talking about?
- Well, it's unclear.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.182
Whether he got injured
when he hit the motorcycle

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:25.226
or got caught on something and was cut.

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.561
I think we need an autopsy.

00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:29.605
What a bunch of nonsense. Forget it.

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:32.775
- And the victim?
- Yes.

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:35.611
The victim's name is Jeong Su-in.
She's 29.

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:41.742
Do you happen to know her?

00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:48.749
Yeah.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:55.464
<i>How is she?</i>

00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:57.591
<i>She's unconscious.</i>

00:11:57.591 --> 00:11:59.260
But they say she's fine.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:03.639
You said she got hit by a car,
so how can she be fine?

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.225
This part is strange too.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:10.104
There are scars on the victim's back
as though she had been stabbed.

00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:13.733
Her clothes were also
heavily stained with her own blood.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.652
But they said
these scars aren't from today.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:43.304
You can never come here again.

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.318
Excuse me. What happened?

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:58.611
Are you feeling better?

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:03.783
Mr. Chul-min.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:04.992
Su-in.

00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:07.536
Are you okay?

00:13:09.663 --> 00:13:11.165
Why am I here?

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:12.708
Do you remember anything

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:15.336
about your sudden attack today?

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.839
Yes, it was the man from the supermarket.

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:20.174
Yes, that man. Right.

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:23.135
That's why I'm here right now.
Are you really okay?

00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:27.181
We had a little argument
at the supermarket,

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:28.724
and he must have followed me.

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:32.269
He ran into me with his car,
and with his knife...

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.649
He did stab me with his knife...

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.068
Thankfully, they say you're not hurt.

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:40.486
What?

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:42.738
But I was stabbed.

00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:45.491
They said those scars seem to be very old.

00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:48.160
Scars? I don't have any scars.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.496
What about your attacker?

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.748
Was he badly injured during the incident?

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:54.708
Not at all.

00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:58.212
He came after me with a knife,

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:01.465
and I was bleeding so much.

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.218
I can't really remember...

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.763
Did you catch the guy?

00:14:08.722 --> 00:14:09.932
He died at the scene.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:13.435
- He was cut from his chest to his face.
- Hey, hold on.

00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:16.146
I'll discuss that with her.
You guys wait outside.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:17.773
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

00:14:17.773 --> 00:14:19.275
Yeah, wait outside.

00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:29.869
I don't understand.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.871
That man stabbed me with a knife

00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:34.915
and followed me,
but he just suddenly died?

00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:39.169
When you suddenly go through
a traumatic event,

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:42.423
your thoughts can get mixed up
and distorted.

00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:45.426
You don't need to try hard
to remember things right now, okay?

00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:46.927
But

00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:49.972
I'm positive I was stabbed.

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:52.892
Why?

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.269
What makes you so sure?

00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:58.814
As I was being stabbed, I was thinking,

00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:01.358
"Here we go again."

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:06.071
-"Here we go again"?
- Yes.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.657
Yet again, I am dogged by misfortune.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.912
There's this feeling I'm used to.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.041
"It seems my misfortune has returned."

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:21.587
Su-in, nothing like that
will happen again.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:24.798
I had the same feeling when I was ten
and my dad was abusing me.

00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:27.551
When my dad threw a fit
while holding an iron,

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:30.012
or beat me and broke my bones,

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.140
I had the same thought.

00:15:34.975 --> 00:15:36.936
"It seems my misfortune has returned."

00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:40.439
The moment I got stabbed,

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.401
that thought suddenly came
into my mind again.

00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:50.366
No, nothing like that
will ever happen again. Okay?

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:53.535
If you hadn't saved me from my father,

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:55.287
I wouldn't even be alive.

00:15:56.997 --> 00:15:58.749
You're the one who called the police.

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:04.713
You think it's easy for a ten-year-old kid
to report her own father to the police?

00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:07.633
I wasn't the one who saved you.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.219
You saved yourself.

00:16:12.721 --> 00:16:13.555
And

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.559
you'll still be the only one
who can save yourself going forward.

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:22.314
That's how it is.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:27.319
Just let me know what happened today
when you remember.

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:30.406
Hey, I'm so relieved
that you're all right.

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:31.991
Got it?

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.786
Call me right away if you need anything
or something comes to mind.

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:39.957
Get some rest.

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:57.599
Captain.

00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:00.060
Gosh, I'm sorry I'm late.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.603
You sure took your time.

00:17:01.603 --> 00:17:03.147
Were you at the church service?

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:05.149
Won-seok, praying doesn't suit you.

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:06.233
Shut up.

00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:07.317
You go to church?

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:09.820
Forget it. Just go home.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.405
You've interviewed the victim?

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:13.782
- I wanted to meet her too.
- Let's take a breather.

00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:15.242
Come in at the crack of dawn.

00:17:15.242 --> 00:17:16.243
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:17:16.243 --> 00:17:18.996
If we solve a few of the cases
that happened today,

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:21.874
we'll be shot up
the promotion ladder, right?

00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:43.771
A FEW MONTHS LATER

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:55.074
Good evening, boss.

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.158
- Sir.
- Sir.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:06.668
Has the Mangnani Gang
made any kind of move?

00:18:06.668 --> 00:18:07.961
No, they're quiet, sir.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.007
They can't do a damn thing
even though we took over their business.

00:18:12.007 --> 00:18:14.635
- They're just small fry.
- Okay, good work.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:15.969
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.694
He went into room number eight.

00:18:58.387 --> 00:18:59.429
You bastard.

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:18.949
Hey, is anyone out there?

00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:23.787
That bastard. Go get that bastard.

00:19:23.787 --> 00:19:25.789
- Come here!
- You motherfucker!

00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:27.624
- Come here!
- Stop, you fucker!

00:19:27.624 --> 00:19:29.376
- Go get him!
- Stop right there!

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.605
We've arrived. Off the bus, please.

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:10.709
<i>You have one new voice mail.</i>

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:18.634
<i>Hey, the Yeongdeungpo guys
are really pissed,</i>

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.594
<i>so lie low for the time being.</i>

00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:22.638
<i>Don't use your cell phone if you can.</i>

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:24.723
<i>Actually, just toss it.</i>

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:27.100

What is it? You scared me.

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:26.118
Has it been so long
you forgot your little brother's face?

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.496
Don't worry. I won't stay for too long.

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:34.042
Well, Jin-hee said
that you have a brain tumor.

00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:35.210
But you look fine.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.046
Is Jin-hee sleeping?

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:40.757
She went somewhere far away.

00:21:43.218 --> 00:21:44.136
Far away, where?

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:45.846
I don't know either.

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:53.895
What the heck is she wearing?

00:22:27.637 --> 00:22:30.223
No matter what,
she never leaves the store unattended.

00:22:30.223 --> 00:22:31.725
But she went somewhere far?

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:33.602
And you don't even know?

00:22:37.814 --> 00:22:38.648
"Ki-seok"?

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:43.570
<i>Outgoing calls

SAEJIN CHURCH
REVIVAL PRAYER MEETING

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:35.330
MR. CHUL-MIN

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:37.999
Hello, Mr. Chul-min.

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:39.418
<i>Hey. Is everything okay?</i>

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:43.171
Yes, nothing unusual.
I've just been going to work.

00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:46.758
<i>Still, take it easy.
You need to take care of yourself.</i>

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:48.343
<i>How about going on a vacation?</i>

00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:51.012
Well, they said I'm fine.

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:54.266
There isn't even anywhere I'd want to go.

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:55.225
<i>Really?</i>

00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:58.478
<i>But still, don't push yourself
too hard, okay?</i>

00:23:58.979 --> 00:24:00.439
Okay, I got it.

00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:04.025
Thank you, Mr. Chul-min.

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:06.945
<i>Jeez, no reason to thank me. Bye, then.</i>

00:24:08.321 --> 00:24:12.659
<i>This stop is Gyeongjin Market.
The next stop is...</i>

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.862
Please open the back door.

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:27.400
I said I'd get us a hotel room nearby.

00:25:28.818 --> 00:25:30.028
I prefer my place.

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:33.365
I know. I prefer your place too, honey.

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:35.825
But don't women usually prefer
going to hotels?

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:39.329
No. I prefer my place.

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:41.289
- I really do.
- Okay.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.751
I love women like you.
Women who cut to the chase.

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:47.420
But you talk down to me a bit.

00:25:55.428 --> 00:25:59.140
Wow, sweetie,
you really live in a remote place.

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:01.309
It's basically falling apart.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.520
Honey, do people actually live here?

00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:07.107
I mean, I'm not saying it's bad.
Are you upset?

00:26:07.107 --> 00:26:10.944
What I meant was that I didn't know
people still lived in places like this.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.698
This place must be undergoing
redevelopment.

00:26:17.158 --> 00:26:21.955
Honey, I think you live in a place
that really doesn't suit your vibe. Right?

00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:27.669
Wow. Let's take a look.

00:26:29.713 --> 00:26:31.590
Honey, you have very unique taste.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.550
I mean, I'm not saying it's weird.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.556
Okay, this isn't the kind of thing
I'm used to.

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:43.268
Already?

00:26:43.893 --> 00:26:45.562
Can I go wash up first?

00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:50.275
Why is the floor...

00:26:53.194 --> 00:26:54.195
What the heck?

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:57.907
Guess these people are your family.

00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:02.078
This human has consumed too much alcohol.

00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:04.080
Is this your father?

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:08.376
If you keep him alive for a while,
the alcohol will dissipate.

00:27:08.376 --> 00:27:12.255
- What?
- How do we keep him alive quietly?

00:27:13.923 --> 00:27:14.799
Who are you people?

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:18.219
Damn! You bastards must think
I'm some kind of pushover.

00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:20.096
Should we sever his arms?

00:27:20.096 --> 00:27:22.682
No, do not cut them off.

00:27:22.682 --> 00:27:26.019
It'd be better to render him unconscious
and tie him up.

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:27.062
Hold on.

00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:29.564
I mean, Jesus.

00:27:29.564 --> 00:27:32.609
Hey, just you wait.
You don't seem to know who I am.

00:27:35.695 --> 00:27:37.030
Don't kill me!

00:27:53.546 --> 00:27:55.924
Get away from me!

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.972
Please save me!

00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:07.727
<i>Target one eliminated!</i>

00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:16.778
<i>Target in sight!</i>

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:31.042
<i>Target two eliminated!</i>

00:28:47.016 --> 00:28:48.226
<i>Two targets, down!</i>

00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:31.352
Are you one of us?

00:29:39.569 --> 00:29:40.779
Have you been captured?

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.781
Don't touch that.

00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:47.827
It's mine.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.223
<i>A target has escaped
to the west side of the roof!</i>

00:30:08.223 --> 00:30:09.766
Captain, are you okay?

00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:11.518
Damn. I tried to catch it alive.

00:30:11.518 --> 00:30:13.228
You tried to catch it alive?

00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:15.730
It'd be good to catch it alive.

00:30:16.689 --> 00:30:18.358
We're short of Hunting Dogs.

00:30:18.858 --> 00:30:20.401
Honey, you're okay, right?

00:30:21.903 --> 00:30:22.987
How's it going inside?

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:25.281
Everything is done. We've killed them all.

00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:27.826
What about that asshole?

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:30.578
He seemed to be in shock,
so we sent him to the hospital.

00:30:30.578 --> 00:30:33.039
Good. You sent one of our guys
to keep an eye on him?

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:33.957
Yes.

00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:41.881
Wow. They're all working together now.

00:30:42.382 --> 00:30:44.801
Were they having
some kind of get-together today?

00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:47.136
There isn't much here.

00:30:47.136 --> 00:30:49.222
These seem to belong to the victims.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.858
Open that door.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.308
What is that?

00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:35.268
Call the forensics team.

00:31:40.356 --> 00:31:41.941
What do you think it means?

00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:44.193
It's the symbol for their pantry.

00:31:44.694 --> 00:31:45.528
Sorry?

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.157
Those bastards have formed
an organization.

00:32:05.506 --> 00:32:07.216
Are you certain she was one of us?

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:15.350
If she is, we must bring her
into our organization.

00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:19.020
Okay.

00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:20.897
I will go now.

00:32:26.653 --> 00:32:29.781
<i>So many people seem to be
having trouble falling asleep.</i>

00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:34.243
<i>If you're having trouble sleeping
because of your worries</i>,

00:32:34.243 --> 00:32:37.538
<i>just like this person
who sent in their story at this late hour,</i>

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:39.999
<i>how about drinking a cup of warm water?</i>

00:32:39.999 --> 00:32:41.125
<i>Have a good night.</i>

00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:42.937
MR. CHUL-MIN

00:34:30.485 --> 00:34:31.402
Who are you?

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.946
Why are you doing this?

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:40.161
You are good at pretending to be human.

00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:42.830
What? What does that even mean?

00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:44.874
Are you one of us?

00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:46.793
She seems different.

00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:49.045
What do you want from me?

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.173
We must check.

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:57.428
Oh fuck!

00:35:15.488 --> 00:35:16.864
I am one of you.

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:29.544
If you are one of us,
you must join our organization.

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:33.589
We must combine our forces to survive.

00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:39.971
SAEJIN CHURCH
REVIVAL PRAYER MEETING

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:43.099
Since you are one of us,
you are always welcome.

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:27.018
Have you seen a puppy?

00:36:27.727 --> 00:36:29.854
Merry! Where are you?

00:36:31.063 --> 00:36:32.064
Merry--

00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:43.826
You saw everything, did you not?

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.247
I did not want
to draw any needless attention,

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.791
but I have no choice except to kill you.

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:52.752
Then fucking kill me!

00:36:52.752 --> 00:36:53.669
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:36:55.504 --> 00:36:57.298
Why were you here watching us?

00:36:59.091 --> 00:37:02.178
My sister was acting weird,
so I followed her here.

00:37:04.472 --> 00:37:06.724
Are you saying
your sister is one of my kin?

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:08.226
Yes.

00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:13.564
Give me your wallet.

Listen carefully to what I tell you now.

00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:34.085
If you do not do as I say,

00:37:35.795 --> 00:37:38.005
I will find you and kill you.

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:42.677
Do you understand?

00:38:11.914 --> 00:38:13.082
Ms. Jeong Su-in?

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:20.339
Fucking hell, that monster was right.

00:38:22.925 --> 00:38:24.176
Who are you?

00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:26.470
I'll make this quick.

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:31.058
You've been sensing unpleasant brain waves
from certain people lately, right?

00:38:32.893 --> 00:38:35.396
Don't go to those people, okay?
They're all monsters.

00:38:35.896 --> 00:38:37.148
That was the message.

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:39.525
What are you talking about?

00:38:40.026 --> 00:38:42.445
I heard you almost got killed
by a lunatic.

00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:43.696
That you got stabbed.

00:38:44.196 --> 00:38:47.366
When that happened, a monster...
I mean, what do I even call this?

00:38:47.366 --> 00:38:52.038
The larva of a monster went
into your body, Ms. Jeong Su-in, okay?

00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:54.915
Normally, it's supposed to
eat up your entire brain.

00:38:54.915 --> 00:38:56.208
You were so badly injured,

00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:58.961
healing your body prevented it
from consuming your whole brain.

00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:00.713
You were supposed to mutate--

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:03.758
Fuck! What the hell am I even saying?

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:08.387
So the thing is, simply put,

00:39:08.387 --> 00:39:10.306
you're a mutant, okay?

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:13.351
You know Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde, yeah? Hyde?

00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:16.937
- Who told you this?
- You. Mr. Hyde.

00:39:16.937 --> 00:39:20.483
Mr. Hyde, you're in there, right?
I told her everything, okay?

00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:21.525
I'm off now.

00:39:24.653 --> 00:39:25.613
Give me that.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:30.845
IS THERE REALLY SOMEONE ELSE IN MY BODY...?

00:41:28.569 --> 00:41:30.571
<i>Everything is exactly
what he said earlier.</i>

00:41:31.071 --> 00:41:32.531
<i>Believe everything he said.</i>

00:41:33.032 --> 00:41:35.576
<i>I need to explain
our condition to you in detail.</i>

00:41:36.535 --> 00:41:38.662
<i>So write down all of your questions.</i>

00:41:51.258 --> 00:41:54.178
WHO ARE YOU? WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU?

00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:06.941
NAMIL POLICE STATION

00:42:14.657 --> 00:42:15.741
What is all this?

00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:25.251
Raise your arms
and turn in 90-degree intervals.

00:42:27.795 --> 00:42:28.629
You may enter.

00:42:30.089 --> 00:42:31.882
- Oh, Captain. Good morning.
- Hi.

00:42:32.424 --> 00:42:34.718
What is this? Is a VIP visiting or what?

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:36.512
- Raise your arms...
- You know...

00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:39.348
They said a special task force
from Seoul is here.

00:42:39.348 --> 00:42:40.766
Certainly special, indeed.

00:42:41.308 --> 00:42:43.310
What? What kind of task force is it?

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.312
Special. A very special one.

00:42:45.312 --> 00:42:47.940
They said there'll be a briefing,
so we'll find out.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:48.857
Stop.

00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:52.152
Raise your arms
and turn in 90-degree intervals.

00:42:57.116 --> 00:42:58.033
You may enter.

00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:00.661
Am I good?

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:02.830
Yes, you may enter.

00:43:08.043 --> 00:43:08.961
Good day, then.

00:43:09.878 --> 00:43:12.298
Hey, what is all of this?

00:43:12.298 --> 00:43:14.800
I hate starting the day
with a gun pointed at me.

00:44:01.055 --> 00:44:03.932
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT BRIEFING

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:10.731
When did they prepare all of this?

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.162
"Body snatchers"?

00:44:26.038 --> 00:44:28.207
Wow. Hey, what is all that?

00:44:28.207 --> 00:44:29.958
Wow. They've prepared a lot.

00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:31.251
Jeez!

00:44:40.969 --> 00:44:43.931
EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO PARASITE
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT BRIEFING

00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:47.768
Hello, everyone here
at Namil Police Station.

00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:52.147
Chief, thank you so much
for being here today.

00:44:52.815 --> 00:44:56.318
Okay, everyone, shall we give the chief
a round of applause?

00:45:01.156 --> 00:45:03.701
Well, let me start by introducing myself.

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:09.081
My name is Choi Jun-kyung, team captain

00:45:09.081 --> 00:45:11.959
of the parasite special forces unit,
Team Grey.

00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:17.548
It must've been such a hassle for you all
to get screened this morning.

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:21.093
Well, I'll tell you the bottom line first.

00:45:21.093 --> 00:45:26.181
We took X-rays of your bodies
this morning.

00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:28.392
And among you,

00:45:29.226 --> 00:45:31.270
we found

00:45:31.937 --> 00:45:32.896
no parasites!

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:34.106
A round of applause!

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:38.110
What is this,
some kindergarten talent show?

00:45:38.736 --> 00:45:41.405
Well, do we have to do this daily?

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:42.322
Not at all.

00:45:42.823 --> 00:45:45.117
The screening was only required today.

00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:49.663
That's because the parasites
showed up all at once,

00:45:49.663 --> 00:45:53.041
and it seems they have already finished
synchronizing with human hosts.

00:45:53.542 --> 00:45:57.713
So it has been confirmed,
based on the one-time screening today,

00:45:57.713 --> 00:45:59.840
that none of you are parasites.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.093
My saying "parasite this"
and "parasite that" must seem strange.

00:46:04.052 --> 00:46:06.305
So let me explain.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.602
EDM FESTIVAL
SUSPECT DEAD AT THE SCENE

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:12.603
So, you all remember

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:16.565
the case of the motiveless killing
at an EDM festival recently, right?

00:46:17.524 --> 00:46:20.819
The truth behind the incident
you're all aware of...

00:46:22.821 --> 00:46:23.697
is this.

00:46:24.406 --> 00:46:29.536
The monster you see here
ruthlessly slashing away at people

00:46:29.536 --> 00:46:30.788
is a parasite.

00:46:32.331 --> 00:46:35.626
You might wonder where it is
and what it is doing now, right?

00:46:37.544 --> 00:46:39.671
Right now, he is...

00:46:41.924 --> 00:46:42.841
right here!

00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:48.972
In order to prevent social chaos,

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:53.352
Team Grey put together a team
to restrict media access

00:46:53.352 --> 00:46:57.940
and have been strictly controlling
all information about this parasite.

00:47:00.442 --> 00:47:01.443
A few months ago,

00:47:01.443 --> 00:47:06.406
the larvae of this parasite started
popping up all over Korea,

00:47:06.406 --> 00:47:08.283
as well as all over the world.

00:47:09.076 --> 00:47:12.955
The origin of these larvae
is still unknown.

00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:16.250
Once they penetrate the human body,

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.878
through the ears, nose, or mouth,
they then take over the brain.

00:47:20.587 --> 00:47:23.382
They consume the brain.

00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:27.845
Now, once the parasites complete
their mutation,

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:31.515
they follow their instincts
and try to eat humans.

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:33.433
Here is an important characteristic.

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:37.646
They can freely transform their head.

00:47:37.646 --> 00:47:42.651
These parasites can transform
their rigidity and shape

00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:45.821
and change their heads
into something like sharp blades.

00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:47.781
The cell itself

00:47:47.781 --> 00:47:50.868
is an independent living organism
capable of processing thoughts.

00:47:51.493 --> 00:47:53.370
These terrifying creatures

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:58.333
have infiltrated human society
and are targeting us right now.

00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:02.713
<i>At first, I was a larva.</i>

00:48:03.505 --> 00:48:05.799
<i>I followed my instincts
to take over a human brain,</i>

00:48:05.799 --> 00:48:07.259
<i>leading me to go after yours.</i>

00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:26.987
<i>So I tried to eat your brain
and parasitize your body</i>,

00:48:26.987 --> 00:48:30.824
<i>but then I realized
your body was seriously wounded.</i>

00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:34.202
<i>So I tried to synchronize
with your entire body</i>

00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:36.121
<i>to heal the wounds first.</i>

00:48:36.622 --> 00:48:39.249
<i>As a result, I was able to save your body</i>

00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:43.295
<i>but I failed
to take over your brain completely.</i>

00:48:43.295 --> 00:48:45.631
<i>Once synchronized, the parasite</i>

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.759
completely takes over the human brain.

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:54.014
And the human consciousness is also
entirely absorbed by the parasites.

00:48:54.014 --> 00:48:57.643
So they're no longer the humans
we once knew.

00:48:58.518 --> 00:49:00.228
Their brains have been taken over.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.899
Now only their bodies live on,

00:49:04.483 --> 00:49:08.320
becoming nothing but a source
of nourishment to these parasites.

00:49:09.404 --> 00:49:11.740
<i>Because I failed to take over your brain,</i>

00:49:13.033 --> 00:49:15.494
<i>I can only take over your brain
when you face danger</i>

00:49:16.995 --> 00:49:18.789
<i>to protect this body we share.</i>

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.127
<i>Based on my experiments
with your body so far,</i>

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:28.632
<i>I can only take over your consciousness
for about 15 minutes a day.</i>

00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:33.512
<i>So I'm using
the bare minimum amount of time</i>

00:49:33.512 --> 00:49:36.139
<i>to protect this body and sustain my life.</i>

00:49:37.724 --> 00:49:38.600
Excuse me.

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:42.938
What can we do to kill the parasites?

00:49:42.938 --> 00:49:46.858
Well, the parasites will
wither away and die

00:49:46.858 --> 00:49:48.443
without a human host.

00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:52.823
So, to attack the parasite,

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:55.826
we need to destroy the human body.

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:59.287
That means you must destroy
the human body the parasite lives in.

00:49:59.287 --> 00:50:01.873
So you have to cause
a massive hemorrhage at once

00:50:01.873 --> 00:50:04.292
or destroy the heart in one go.

00:50:05.544 --> 00:50:09.006
So, rather than a rifle,
which has a small impact point,

00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:11.091
using a knife...

00:50:16.221 --> 00:50:19.099
or a shotgun like this

00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:21.518
is more effective

00:50:22.269 --> 00:50:26.565
in destroying the heart in one go.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:32.779
Is X-ray imaging the only way
to identify parasites?

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:36.616
Well, these parasites
are mingling among us,

00:50:36.616 --> 00:50:38.201
pretending to be human beings.

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:42.497
But it's not like we can carry around
an X-ray machine at all times, right?

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.460
You can pluck out a strand of hair.

00:50:47.586 --> 00:50:48.545
IDENTIFYING PARASITES

00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:50.797
The parasites are made up
of a single cell mass.

00:50:50.797 --> 00:50:53.383 line:20%
They can live briefly
even if they are cut into pieces.

00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:55.886 line:20%
But the smaller the pieces
they divide into,

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:57.345 line:20%
the less intelligent they get,

00:50:57.345 --> 00:50:59.681 line:20%
and they lose the ability
to return to their form.

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:05.562
If it is as small as a strand of hair,
it will wither and crumble away.

00:51:06.271 --> 00:51:09.149
So, if you suspect someone around you,

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:12.235
pluck out a strand of their hair.

00:51:14.488 --> 00:51:16.782
Then, I'll move on to the next part.

00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:20.494
Fortunate or not,
in the case of our country,

00:51:20.494 --> 00:51:22.913
the parasite showed up at an EDM festival

00:51:23.497 --> 00:51:27.584
and went on a rampage,
killing people, as you saw earlier.

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:29.878
So the numerous pieces
of evidence left behind

00:51:29.878 --> 00:51:32.047
revealed the existence of these parasites.

00:51:32.047 --> 00:51:34.966
A parasite task force
was formed faster here

00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:37.636
than in any other country in the world.

00:51:37.636 --> 00:51:40.388
Therefore, our research was expedited.

00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:45.227
And the one who sped up that research was...

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.904
my husband.

00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:57.864
- What? Her husband?
- Oh my.

00:51:58.532 --> 00:52:02.619
Or to be more precise, the parasite
who took over my husband's brain.

00:52:03.995 --> 00:52:04.955
Don't be afraid.

00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:09.334
Now, the mask over this one's head
is fitted with a special device.

00:52:09.334 --> 00:52:12.629
This mask is equipped with a device

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:15.382
that sprays a chemical the parasites hate.

00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:19.928
So if you press the button
on this remote control...

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.099
it sprays out the chemical,

00:52:24.099 --> 00:52:26.768
and the parasite will be immobilized.

00:52:26.768 --> 00:52:30.063
Also, there's a sensor inside this mask.

00:52:30.063 --> 00:52:33.024
So if this thing tries
to transform its head and escape,

00:52:33.024 --> 00:52:36.278
the sensor will release
the chemical automatically,

00:52:36.278 --> 00:52:38.405
causing it immense pain.

00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:40.490
Excuse me.

00:52:41.199 --> 00:52:44.953
But why are you keeping that thing alive?

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.915
One of the characteristics
we have discovered about parasites is

00:52:48.915 --> 00:52:53.962
that they can use brain waves
to detect other parasites around them.

00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:56.798
So, we are using this one

00:52:57.299 --> 00:53:01.094
as a radar to detect other parasites.

00:53:01.595 --> 00:53:06.057
We call this parasite "the Hunting Dog."

00:53:07.559 --> 00:53:11.313
<i>The people with whom you have
a strange feeling are our kin.</i>

00:53:12.314 --> 00:53:14.858
<i>And they can also sense
that you are one of them.</i>

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:19.529
<i>But if they discover you are a mutant,
they might try eliminating you.</i>

00:53:20.322 --> 00:53:22.908
<i>So approaching any of them
is too dangerous</i>

00:53:22.908 --> 00:53:25.911
<i>if you wish to continue to survive.</i>

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.122
<i>I am trying to warn you of that.</i>

00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:32.292
<i>It is crucial
that we know each other clearly,</i>

00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:34.502
<i>so I left a video of myself
on your cell phone.</i>

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.492
<i>Our Hunting Dog has informed us</i>

00:54:05.492 --> 00:54:09.704
that the highest concentration
of parasites is in Namil-gun,

00:54:09.704 --> 00:54:11.706
where Namil Police Station is located.

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:18.421
We plan to stay here for a few days
and hunt down the parasites.

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:23.551
If there have been any unsolved murders
or suspicious cases recently,

00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:24.928
please report them to us.

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:29.766
Those cases may be related to parasites.

00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:30.934
Do you understand?

00:54:32.143 --> 00:54:32.978
I mean,

00:54:33.812 --> 00:54:37.190
isn't it unethical
to torment a human like that?

00:54:37.899 --> 00:54:38.733
Come again?

00:54:47.242 --> 00:54:48.618
If you think like that

00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:51.037
for even one moment...

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.465
then this will happen to you.

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:16.730
This thing is no longer my husband.

00:55:17.772 --> 00:55:21.276
It is nothing but a monster, an insect,
a virus that needs to be exterminated!

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.445
Once they've become parasites,

00:55:23.445 --> 00:55:25.864
you can't consider them human anymore!

00:55:27.198 --> 00:55:28.199
Do you understand?

00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:29.951
Got it?

00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:33.009
