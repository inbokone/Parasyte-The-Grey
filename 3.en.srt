WEBVTT

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:13.388
You always buy so much food.

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:15.598
Will we be able to eat all of this?

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.684
Don't worry. We'll eat it if it's there.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.601
Oh, wait.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:20.562
The receipt.

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:23.189
We need it to get the parking validated.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.233
It won't be that much. Let's just go.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.318
No, just wait here.

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:29.029
Start the car. I won't be long.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.655
Hey, Jun-kyung!

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.867
Always sweating the small stuff.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.330
I just don't get her at times.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:49.007
What is that?

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.105
Run!

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.028
Hurry up and run! Someone just got killed!

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:18.411
Honey!

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:25.668
Honey!

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:27.796
Honey!

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.049
My goodness. What are you doing?

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.993
Mommy!

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:01.663
Mommy, where are you?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.291
Mommy!

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.544
Mommy, where are you?

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:11.589
Oh, Su-jin.

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.633
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Mommy.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.510
- Thank you.
- Mommy, I'm scared.

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:36.567
PARASYTE: THE GREY

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.705
You didn't give me a toothbrush.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.917
That'll be 1,000 won.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.713
God, why is this whole town
freaking obsessed with money?

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.049
I'll use it cleanly
and give it back to you.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:14.022
Which one are you?

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.734
It's confusing.
You're not that one, right?

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:24.532
Definitely not.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:26.743
Sit down. I need to talk to you.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:35.501
Now, I'm going to tell you
something important. Okay?

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.088
Mr. Hyde, you're listening
in there, right?

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.009
I'll assume you are.

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:49.682
All we can do right now
is report those monsters to the police.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.893
- The police?
- Yeah.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:55.480
We'll tell them
that Saejin Church is full of corpses.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.650
And it'll be dangerous if our identities
are exposed, so we'll remain anonymous.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.446
I know a police officer.

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:05.490
Can we trust him?

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:11.996
He was the detective in charge of my case
when I reported my dad a long time ago.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.624
You reported your own dad?

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:19.003
For beating me so much.

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.882
He's looked out for me ever since.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.217
Damn.

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.678
Your life's been brutal,
just like the one inside you.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:32.517
Anyway, we'll report the monsters.
We should do it by phone, right?

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:37.730
You agree, right? Hey, Hyde.

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:40.316
Mr. Hyde, we're all
on the same page, right?

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.486
Hyde sounds too terrifying.
What'd be a good name?

00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:46.114
How about Heidi? That's not scary.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.491
Is it too cute? Yeah?

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:50.868
Anyway, Ms. Heidi,

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.247
whether those monsters
are your kin or not,

00:06:55.873 --> 00:06:57.750
I have to report them.

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.507
For the sake of my older sister

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:07.510
and my little sister Jin-hee.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:10.805
If nothing else,

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.641
I can never forgive them
for killing my younger sister.

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:24.652
I'm sorry.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:26.946
No.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.491
It wasn't your doing. Okay, let's go.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.411
Let's call the police. Get up.

00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:39.417
Do you have coins?

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:47.842
- Hey, Min-su.
- Yes, sir.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.302
About this... One second.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:52.972
Hello?

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.141
- <i>Is this Captain Kim Chul-min?</i>
- Send it today.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:58.227
- Who's calling?
- Well, who I am is not important.

00:07:58.227 --> 00:07:59.187
You see,

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.355
I have something urgent to report.

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:03.691
May I ask how you got my number?

00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:07.195
<i>You don't need to know that, sir.
Let's keep it anonymous.</i>

00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:11.407
There's a place called Saejin Church
in Namcheon.

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:14.619
Saejin Church. It's deep in the mountains.

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:17.622
The place is swarming with monsters.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.833
<i>- Real monsters.</i>
- What?

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.711
Normally, they look just like humans,

00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:26.255
but then their faces suddenly split open,

00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:28.966
and these crazy tentacles pop out.

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:31.886
They use them to attack and kill people.

00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:34.514
<i>There are a lot of corpses there.</i>

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.016
Check it out. I reported it, okay?

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.476
May I ask who you are--

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:47.401
Damn. I never thought
I'd report anything to the police.

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:50.905
How will we know
if the police took care of them?

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:53.324
We can just call that cop again later.

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:56.911
For now, we need to lie low together.

00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:58.287
What?

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:02.708
Hey, there are two of you,
and I'm all alone.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.877
Heidi will protect you.
She should protect me too.

00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:07.505
But I have to go to work.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:09.715
Where?

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:11.801
The supermarket.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:14.971
<i>Yes, hello.</i>

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.265
This is Su-in's cousin calling.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:20.643
I brought her some food
for the first time in a long time

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:23.521
and found her coughing
and running a high fever.

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:27.275
Right. I'm afraid
she won't be able to work today.

00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:30.528
Oh, you're a very kind boss.

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:32.780
Sure, I'll take good care of her

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.825
and come by to say thank you
once she gets better.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:36.742
Thank you.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.456
You're a really good liar.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.543
I did theater in middle school.

00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:49.714
It was an all-boys school,
so I played Juliet.

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:52.592 line:20%
SAEJIN CHURCH

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.470
Saejin Church.

00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:00.433
A place like this
in the middle of a mountain?

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.063
Do we really need to go check it out?

00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:08.357
A report came in, so we should.

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:10.818
Hey, besides...

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:15.114
he said something about monsters.

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:16.532
The parasites?

00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:18.826
He described them in detail.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.494
Oh, really?

00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:25.207
It'll be such a headache
if there really are monsters there.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.670
Should we inform Team Grey--

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.964
Keep it down.

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:33.924
We don't even know who filed the report.

00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:35.885
Okay. I'll talk to Team Grey.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.428
Just wait.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.848
But what if they really are there?

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:43.726
Fine, I'll do it.

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:46.937
Keep it quiet.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.915
Oh, Captain Kim.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:07.416
Yes, hello.

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:09.168
I was actually hoping to see you.

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:11.504
Oh, really? Regarding what?

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:14.048
You know that girl, Jeong Su-in?

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.259
I saw that you handled two of her cases.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.179
One from when she was a child
and one recently.

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:21.430 line:20%
ATTEMPTED MURDER OF CLERK

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:23.974
Sure.

00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:26.102
She works at a supermarket.

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.771
She was involved
in an altercation with a customer.

00:11:29.313 --> 00:11:30.898
I met with her yesterday.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.442
She's working hard at the supermarket.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.321
I checked her hair as well.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:38.948
No issues found.

00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:42.618
I guess you two are close.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.037
What brings you here?

00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:46.455
Right.

00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:51.377
Someone tipped us off
about a place called Saejin Church.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:54.588
He said it was swarming
with monsters or something.

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:59.760
I'm guessing you thought
the report seemed credible.

00:12:00.344 --> 00:12:03.431
I'm not sure.
But he described them in such detail--

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.515
- Captain.
- So...

00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:11.397
I think your hunch is right.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:13.315
- Get the team ready.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:15.359
Thank you for the tip-off.

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:16.277
What?

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:18.863
We don't know who it was from yet...

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.617
Damn it.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.538
Gather the boys quickly.

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.090
- Hurry up, guys!
- Yes, sir!

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.050
It's number five, okay?

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.927
Yes, we'll call you when we arrive.

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.640
The situation has blown up.

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:49.477
Damn it, let's go.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.713
What's the smaller building next to it?

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.716
It looks like a warehouse
with a cooling system.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.719
- Add that to the search perimeter.
- Will do.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.846
But it's too quiet here.

00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:32.645
What do you think?

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.314
Are they really not here?

00:13:36.857 --> 00:13:37.691
Not even one?

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.200
If you sense anything,
you know what to do, right?

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.952
Don't forget to press the button.

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:52.248
By the way,
what is he holding in his hand?

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.834
A device that sends us a signal

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.086
when he senses parasites nearby.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:02.174
He hasn't sensed anything so far.
Doesn't that mean there's nothing inside?

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.052
- He could also be lying.
- What?

00:14:05.052 --> 00:14:07.012
- We're ready to enter.
- Get started.

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:48.262
Remove the cover.

00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:56.312
We found multiple body parts.

00:15:04.486 --> 00:15:06.447
This must have been their pantry too.

00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:13.621
Right side, clear.

00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:15.581
Left side, clear. All clear.

00:15:34.975 --> 00:15:36.685
I don't think anything is here.

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:40.189
I'll check the other side.

00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:46.028
What the hell were they doing in here?

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:08.592
Here.

00:16:10.177 --> 00:16:11.011
What is this?

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.068
Did you find anything?

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.029
Oh.

00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:31.031
No, not really.

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:33.617
Doesn't seem to be much here.

00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:35.661
What about next door?

00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:38.956
Go check it out. It's a total mess.

00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:56.432
As you can see, most of the bodies
discovered at the scene

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:59.893
were mutilated and cut into pieces,
so it'll take a while to confirm

00:16:59.893 --> 00:17:02.479
the number of victims
and their identities.

00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:04.773
We have confirmed
over 500 body fragments so far.

00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:06.692
Analyzing the DNA of each piece

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:09.403
and combining them
to verify the victims' identities

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:11.030
is very time-consuming.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.615
A few forensic teams are working on it.

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:16.035
Who is in charge of that church?

00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:20.706
Kwon Hyuk-ju, 42 years old.

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:24.168
He's a pastor
who founded the church 15 years ago.

00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:25.502
Where is this pastor now?

00:17:26.503 --> 00:17:30.132
A few weeks ago,
his in-laws reported him missing.

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:33.093
Both he and his wife
are currently missing.

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:35.804
Either both have become parasites,

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:39.183
or one might have eaten the other.

00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:43.437
Was anything else found at the church?

00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:46.273
Until recently,
quite a lot of them were gathered there.

00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:48.692
But they seem to have moved elsewhere,

00:17:48.692 --> 00:17:50.194
taking only important items.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.657
What do you think, Captain Kim?

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:57.785
About what?

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:01.205
Did anyone from your station
find anything notable?

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:04.333
Well, we didn't find
anything notable either.

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:08.087
I mean, we've never seen
anything like this before.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.589
So no, nothing to note.

00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:14.510
Then let's find
that freaking pastor first.

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:18.555
We should check out
his last known residence first.

00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:21.183
The Namil Police can take
the lead on that.

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.812
Here, I'll do it, ma'am. I will.

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:28.482
Okay, then we'll begin
our detailed inspection,

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:29.983
starting with Saejin Church.

00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:31.193
Let's move quickly.

00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:33.320
Okay, then.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:38.700
Want me to come with you?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.161
No, I'll go alone. It's just legwork.

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:00.597
Hey, sweetie.

00:19:00.597 --> 00:19:02.808
<i>Dad, I got a perfect score
on my English test.</i>

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.768
Wow! You did?

00:19:04.768 --> 00:19:07.813
How many kids got a perfect score?
Were you the only one?

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:08.730
<i>Yes, just me!</i>

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.235
Wow, great job. You did so well.
Sweetie, I'm so proud of you.

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:16.905
I'll pick up something yummy
on my way home. Bye.

00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:19.950
- <i>Okay, come home soon.</i>
- Okay, yeah. Bye, sweetie.

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:58.989
God. You all seem okay.

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:03.076
God.

00:20:03.076 --> 00:20:06.163
Pastor, your new chapel looks wonderful.

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:08.373
It's not bad for a last-minute find.

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:11.001
Damn.

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:14.588
Sorry to interrupt your meal.

00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:17.007
Thanks to you, we were able to escape.

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.467
Oh, don't mention it.

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:19.885
That was close.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.554
Thank goodness
you all got out on time, right?

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:24.848
More importantly, who reported us?

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:26.767
I'm not sure.

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:30.646
Someone made an anonymous call
from a public pay phone.

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:33.232
All I heard was that it was a man.
What's going on here?

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.400
It must be the younger brother of my host.

00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:39.655
- We must catch him.
- What happened to the one that chased him?

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:41.782
He is dead.

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:45.535
Judging by his wounds,
it was clearly our own kin's doing.

00:20:47.454 --> 00:20:51.500
Why the freaking hell would you kill
your own kin? Damn it.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.169
Even all your forces combined
wouldn't be enough.

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:57.172
And yet, you're betraying each other?

00:20:57.839 --> 00:20:59.549
This isn't what I signed up for.

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.593
"Betray"?

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:05.722
I didn't mean it like that.

00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:10.852
It sounds unfitting coming from you.

00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:12.980
Is this...

00:21:17.567 --> 00:21:19.444
what you call "funny"?

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.783
Yes, that's the right facial expression.

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:26.827
Anyway, is this place safe?

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.332
As long as the Hunting Dog is alive,
this place is not safe.

00:21:32.332 --> 00:21:33.250
First,

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:36.086
we must kill that Hunting Dog.

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:40.340
Why is this all so complicated?

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:44.553
What is this?

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:45.804
You will need this.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.892
We crafted the blade
as close to our tentacles as possible.

00:21:51.768 --> 00:21:54.646
It'll be difficult for us to approach
and kill the Hunting Dog

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.815
since our kin can
quickly sense each other.

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:05.449
You, a human, must be the one to kill him.

00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:13.665
<i>I'm in Dongyeong-dong,
selected for redevelopment--</i>

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:17.169
<i>People are heading out on excursions
to enjoy the wonderful weather--</i>

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.338
<i>In Namcheon,
the opening of the war memorial...</i>

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:21.340
What the hell? Why isn't it on the news?

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:25.093
They could've handled it discreetly.

00:22:25.093 --> 00:22:27.512
<i>The mayor of Namcheon
is also expected to attend--</i>

00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:30.849
MR. CHUL-MIN

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:31.933
Who is it?

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:36.104
Is it that detective? Answer it.

00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:38.231
We need information. Answer it.

00:22:40.817 --> 00:22:41.735
Hello, Mr. Chul-min.

00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.528
- Hey, Su-in.
- <i>Yes.</i>

00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:45.572
Well,

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.658
do you think we can meet up briefly?

00:22:49.576 --> 00:22:51.078
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

00:22:52.954 --> 00:22:55.665
Could you give me a moment?
I'll call you right back.

00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:57.417
Sure, okay.

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.219
Why didn't you ask?

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.638
That'd be like confessing
that we tipped them off.

00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:11.765
Oh, that's true. What did he say?

00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:14.935
He wants to meet later
to talk about something.

00:23:15.936 --> 00:23:18.605
Hey, didn't you see how I was backstabbed?

00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:21.191
Maybe he already knows everything.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.778
But still, he is the only person
I can trust right now.

00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:28.365
- Meeting him is the only option we've got.
- Okay.

00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:32.702
Text him saying you want to meet
somewhere remote and quiet.

00:23:32.702 --> 00:23:34.413
I still don't trust anyone.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.504
Tell him to come
to Changseong Theme Park in 30 minutes.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.591
Send it.

00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:55.183
LET'S MEET AT CHANGSEONG THEME PARK
IN 30 MINUTES

00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:05.652
It hurts so much.

00:24:05.652 --> 00:24:07.779
- Get going.
- Come on, let go of me.

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.739
Damn it, I'll go a little later.

00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:11.116
- Let go of me.
- Come with us.

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.909
- Hey, I said I'm coming.
- Shut up!

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.619
Seriously!

00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:21.126
Can you contact the traffic department
and ask for their assistance

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:23.503
in tracking down Captain Kim's car?

00:25:16.097 --> 00:25:17.015
Hey, what's up?

00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:19.559
I told you I was doing legwork.

00:25:20.435 --> 00:25:21.853
We're being dispatched now?

00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:27.108
No, it's okay. I'll join you.
Just send me the address.

00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:28.443
Okay.

00:25:49.005 --> 00:25:50.840
I didn't know this was here.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.133
Oh, you didn't know?

00:25:52.884 --> 00:25:57.514
My sisters and I would hop the fence
to play in here as kids.

00:25:58.014 --> 00:25:58.974
See that over there?

00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:02.644
People said someone fell from there,
so this place went belly-up.

00:26:04.104 --> 00:26:06.439
But that was just a rumor. No one died.

00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:11.403
Hey, you mentioned your dad earlier.

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:15.949
What about your mom? What's she up to?

00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:20.120
Living happily with another man
and her other kid.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.122
Forget it. I know how this goes.

00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:25.458
It's good that she is happy,
don't you think?

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:29.462
You and I are basically orphans now.

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:31.673
Let's help each other out.

00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:34.593
Orphans, my foot. We're both adults.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.597
Besides, we're all alone in the end.

00:26:44.477 --> 00:26:45.312
Hey, Su-in.

00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:50.650
Wait.

00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:52.986
Who are you?

00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:57.449
We lived at the same orphanage,
and now I'm her guardian.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.660
Is that so? Wait there for a second.

00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:03.371
Su-in, can I have a word?

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.710
Mr. Chul-min, is something wrong?

00:27:10.337 --> 00:27:12.756
Can you show me the keychain I gave you?

00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:17.927
I'm sorry, I lost it.

00:27:27.854 --> 00:27:29.272
Where did you find this?

00:27:30.857 --> 00:27:32.359
You went to Saejin Church, right?

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:35.153
What happened there?

00:27:37.113 --> 00:27:39.699
It's okay. You can tell me.

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:47.999
Su-in...

00:27:49.918 --> 00:27:51.503
are you in danger right now?

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:53.963
It's not that.

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:24.536
Are you certain?

00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:33.086
Where are you?

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:34.713
Ten minutes?

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.508
I'll go in first. Come to my location.

00:28:56.192 --> 00:28:58.027
It's them. We have to go.

00:28:58.653 --> 00:28:59.863
You have to run too.

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:01.614
Su-in, look at me.

00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:03.324
Are you really Su-in?

00:29:03.324 --> 00:29:05.827
- I'll explain everything later.
- Su-in!

00:29:05.827 --> 00:29:07.620
- We have to go.
- Just tell me.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.913
You punk.

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:10.832
- Mr. Chul-min!
- Hey, who are you?

00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:13.001
- Who the hell are you?
- Please let him go.

00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:14.419
It's not what you think.

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:16.796
- Did you go to Saejin Church?
- What?

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:22.635
Oh, it's you.
You're the one who called me, right?

00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:24.012
Who the hell are you?

00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:27.515
What did you see at Saejin Church?
Tell me, you bastard.

00:29:27.515 --> 00:29:28.433
Tell me!

00:29:37.066 --> 00:29:38.359
Mr. Chul-min!

00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:40.236
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.099
This way.

00:30:10.934 --> 00:30:11.768
Get down here.

00:30:37.043 --> 00:30:37.877
Damn it.

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.726
- Get the location.
- Yes, sir.

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:01.442
You guys, go ahead!

00:31:54.537 --> 00:31:56.706
Hey, it's time to call your friend.

00:31:58.207 --> 00:32:01.836
- At this rate, we will all be caught.
- Fuck. You startled me. Seriously.

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.172
I will handle the woman.

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:07.467
- In the meantime, you escape.
- What about you?

00:32:07.467 --> 00:32:09.469
I will take care of her and join you.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:15.558
Fine. I'll go steal a car
and then honk three times.

00:32:15.558 --> 00:32:16.643
Come out then, okay?

00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:19.979
Whatever you do, do it fast.
I won't be able to hold out for long.

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:24.359
Shit!

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:32.241
Captain Choi is over there!

00:32:32.241 --> 00:32:35.203
Team Alpha, proceed inside.
Team Bravo, secure the perimeter.

00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:36.663
Support those inside.

00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:47.715
Clear.

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.635
I can't get a lock on the target.
Moving in.

00:33:42.937 --> 00:33:44.022
Damn it.

00:33:56.993 --> 00:33:57.910
Target spotted.

00:34:00.455 --> 00:34:02.290
Stop. We're warning you. Step back.

00:34:09.005 --> 00:34:10.631
Captain, are you all right?

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.175
Damn it.

00:34:47.043 --> 00:34:48.628
There's another parasite.

00:34:51.631 --> 00:34:53.049
You two, follow me.

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:56.094
Catch that bitch alive.
Kill her if you must.

00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.011
Yes, ma'am.

00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:13.528
Hey.

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:37.093
Why the hell
would you betray your own kin?

00:35:59.907 --> 00:36:00.783
Su-in.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.411
- Captain Kim, you can't.
- Move.

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:05.163
- Move, bastard!
- Captain!

00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:06.706
Stop! It's dangerous!

00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:09.542
Captain.

00:36:12.128 --> 00:36:12.962
Su-in.

00:36:13.462 --> 00:36:16.883
Step aside. She could turn
into a parasite at any time.

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:19.093
Call an ambulance.

00:36:21.304 --> 00:36:23.181
Call an ambulance and lower your guns!

00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:25.766
We've been ordered to kill her.
Step aside!

00:36:26.642 --> 00:36:29.061
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:32.607
This girl is a normal human being.

00:36:32.607 --> 00:36:34.525
So call an ambulance quickly! Come on!

00:36:34.525 --> 00:36:36.527
She's not human but a parasite!

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:37.862
Step aside now!

00:37:36.879 --> 00:37:37.713
Damn it.

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:41.842
Whatever. I've done all that I can.

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:51.102
Lower your guns.

00:37:52.812 --> 00:37:53.938
I said lower your guns!

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:58.150
Captain Kim, this is your last warning.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.820
If you don't comply,
we'll have no choice but to shoot!

00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:05.658
She isn't a parasite.
I guarantee it. So please, okay?

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.286
Seriously, what the hell are you doing?

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:09.203
Let go!

00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:16.085
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:19.797
Let go of me!

00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:22.008
Let me go, you bastards!

00:41:11.927 --> 00:41:16.932
