1
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:18,560
Jin-hee.

2
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,814
You grow crops by yourself
and run the store for your sister.

3
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:24,607
Isn't it tiring?

4
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,652
It's okay. I don't do it all the time.

5
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,405
I'm about to head home too.

6
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,033
Right, by the way,

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:37,495
Mr. Kim said your sister has gotten better
and has been out and about.

8
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,581
Oh, yes.

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,043
She says she's suddenly fine again.

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,838
Still, she might suddenly get worse.
You should take her to a doctor.

11
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,175
She keeps insisting that she won't go,

12
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,677
but I'm taking her tomorrow,
no matter what.

13
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,638
It'd be great
if she really is all better now.

14
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,558
Kyung-hee was like a mother
to you and your brother.

15
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,103
Kang-woo, that punk.

16
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,897
He should come and help you.

17
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,608
That useless bastard. My goodness.

18
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,780
He said he'd earn money in Seoul
to chip in for Kyung-hee's hospital bills.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,741
Don't hold your breath.
As if that fool will do that.

20
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,119
It must be hard for you on your own.

21
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,705
I'll get going now.

22
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,374
Okay. Goodbye, sir.

23
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,292
Bye.

24
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,932
Hello, Ki-seok.

25
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,266
It's Jin-hee.

26
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,102
<i>Hi, Jin-hee. How are you?</i>

27
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,228
<i>So</i>, <i>what's up?</i>

28
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,939
Well, the thing is,

29
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,526
have you spoken to Kang-woo recently?

30
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,443
<i>No.</i>

31
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>It's been a while since we lost touch.</i>

32
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,118
<i>- You don't know his number?</i>
- He hasn't called in a while.

33
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,246
<i>Try sending him a DM.</i>

34
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,081
A DM?

35
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,792
You know, that messenger.

36
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,837
Right. Does Kang-woo still use that?

37
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,883
<i>I'm not sure if he still checks it,
but he might see it later and call you.</i>

38
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,343
Right<i>.</i>

39
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,139
Okay. Then I'll try that.

40
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,807
<i>Okay, call me again anytime.</i>

41
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,684
Okay, bye.

42
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,153
Merry!

43
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,282
What is it? What's wrong?

44
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,375
Who are you?

45
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,753
This is the pastor from my church.

46
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,674
The pastor who wouldn't let you
see a doctor?

47
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,969
Merry, be quiet.
What's gotten into you lately?

48
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,264
Sister Jin-hee,

49
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,684
your sister has told me so much about you.

50
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,687
He visited our home to pray for me.

51
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,856
Don't you think

52
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,026
a church should send a sick person
to the hospital?

53
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,319
What good do prayers do?

54
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,863
Anyway, don't forget,

55
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,823
we're going to the hospital tomorrow.

56
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,367
You're getting an MRI, no matter what.

57
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,286
I do not need to go to the hospital.

58
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,038
Sister Jin-hee,

59
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,625
you shouldn't worry
about your sister anymore.

60
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,213
- By the power of God--
- Excuse me.

61
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,257
Whether she's really better or not,

62
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,343
we need to check.

63
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,766
- She doesn't need to go.
- This doesn't concern you, Pastor.

64
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,740
We should get rid of her right now.

65
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,118
It might cause trouble if we do it here.

66
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,287
No one lives around this place.

67
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,706
Kyung-hee,

68
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,416
what are you saying?

69
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,380
Do you really want to know
what is inside my head?

70
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,016
Merry, run!

71
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,559
Merry! No!

72
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,025
Help! Someone help me!

73
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,208
{\an8}SEOL KANG-WOO
FRIEND ON MESSENGER

KANG-WOO'S FRIEND KI-SEOK

75
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,350
<i>The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a...</i>

76
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,061
Why the hell isn't he answering his phone?

77
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:59,275
IT'S ME KANG-WOO
PICK UP YOUR PHONE, DICKHEAD

78
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,534
- Hello?
<i>- Why are you using Jin-hee's phone?</i>

79
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,119
It's a long story.

80
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,038
Are you still in Cheonan?

81
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,041
<i>No, I moved to Jinyang because of work.</i>

82
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,377
Jinyang? Why did you move so far away?

83
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,630
Anyway, can I crash at your place
for a few days?

84
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,756
<i>When are you coming?</i>

85
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,550
Right now. I should be there
in two hours if I leave now.

86
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,052
CHOI YONG-JAE, CIVILIAN ARMY LEADER

87
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,763
<i>I'm not home.
I'm out taking care of something.</i>

88
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,015
If you don't want me to come, just say so.

89
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:35,061
<i>I'll text you my address
and the passcode. Let yourself in.</i>

90
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,229
Okay. Thanks, man.

91
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,361
Damn.

92
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,077
Hey.

93
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,454
Are you done changing?

94
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,916
We have to go.

95
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,545
Get yourself together, and let's go.

96
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,632
I said let's go.

97
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,959
UNIT 402, CHANGJIN STUDIO APT.
CODE 0823

98
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,386
PARASYTE: THE GREY

99
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,768
<i>Videos posted by eyewitnesses
have already been going viral.</i>

100
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,480
<i>It's a shame this happened
just before the Folk Music Festival.</i>

101
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,232
<i>It's causing us a lot of trouble.</i>

102
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,817
<i>I understand Namil-gun's situation.</i>

103
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,362
<i>But unlike other areas,</i>

104
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,157
<i>the parasites here
work as an organization,</i>

105
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,993
<i>so a large-scale clean-up operation
is inevitable.</i>

106
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,248
If you give us more time,
we can recapture Jeong Su-in.

107
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,336
<i>What's Namil Police's position on this?</i>

108
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,672
We are doing our best as well,

109
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,633
but we can't do that much
since our job is to support Team Grey.

110
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,593
Well, for us, we're in a position

111
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,513
where we simply follow
Captain Choi's orders.

112
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,057
So we can't operate as we see fit.

113
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,892
There's a limit to what we can do.

114
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,227
<i>Listen, Captain Choi,</i>

115
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,398
<i>The transfer operation failed
because you worked in a vacuum</i>

116
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,858
<i>without sharing any information like this.</i>

117
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,820
<i>It's time to inform the public</i>

118
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,322
<i>about the parasites, receive reports,</i>

119
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,285
<i>and work closely with the local police
to eradicate the parasites.</i>

120
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,536
<i>Do I make myself clear?</i>

121
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,537
Yes, sir.

122
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,623
{\an8}<i>And what about
the Korean Folk Music Festival?</i>

123
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,127
{\an8}<i>It's not possible until we destroy
the parasite organization.</i>

124
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,047
{\an8}<i>Team Grey and the Namil Police
will do their best</i>

125
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,342
<i>to eradicate it completely
before the event takes place.</i>

126
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,345
<i>Do you think
this festival is some kind of joke?</i>

127
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,472
{\an8}<i>This festival is to celebrate</i>

128
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,892
{\an8}<i>the opening
of the Choi Yong-jae Memorial Hall!</i>

129
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:06,147
<i>You do know that he led the Battle
of Cheonryongsan during the Korean War?</i>

130
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,734
<i>It's a tourist attraction
that our district spent years developing.</i>

131
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,945
<i>Numerous merchants here
make their living through this festival.</i>

132
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,114
<i>And you're telling us
to cancel the festival</i>

133
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,366
<i>because of those so-called monsters?</i>

134
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,660
{\an8}<i>What you're all saying is ridiculous.</i>

135
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,121
{\an8}<i>Especially this year,</i>

136
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,582
{\an8}<i>with a visit scheduled
from the mayor of Namcheon.</i>

137
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,167
<i>I'm reporting this to him!</i>

138
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,294
<i>Sir, please calm down.</i>

139
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,547
{\an8}<i>For now, we'll do our best.</i>

140
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,924
{\an8}<i>This is our mayor's last year in office.</i>

141
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,553
{\an8}<i>As you know, he's a key candidate
for the next presidential election.</i>

142
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:42,433
{\an8}<i>This year's festival
is the last big occasion for him as mayor.</i>

143
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,227
{\an8}<i>This is not something
we can just cancel on a whim!</i>

144
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,022
<i>Captain Choi,</i>

145
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,774
<i>I'll give you three days.</i>

146
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,317
<i>Can you get it done?</i>

147
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,404
- Yes, sir.
<i>- We don't have much time, so get to work.</i>

148
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:07,291
It'll be a tough three days, but they say
a crisis can turn into an opportunity.

149
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,043
Is it not a good thing, then?

150
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,295
You said humans like drama.

151
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,631
Hold on. Come this way.

152
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,346
You see,

153
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,641
when Jeong Su-in was captured,

154
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,227
her X-rays came back as normal.

155
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,478
How is this possible?

156
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,315
She is a mutant.

157
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,484
What does that mean?

158
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,112
I need to find out
what kind of mutant she is.

159
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:47,915
The man who is accompanying
the girl of our kin has been located.

160
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,626
That girl is a mutant mixed with a human.

161
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,044
Do you need support?

162
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,421
No.

163
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,214
<i>She is very powerful.</i>

164
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,008
I can handle her by myself.

165
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,970
<i>Okay. Come to the meeting place
when you are done.</i>

166
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,437
Regardless of what she's doing,

167
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,315
we should get started
with our business now, yeah?

168
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,488
Pastor.

169
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,741
No, I mean Captain. Look.

170
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:26,996
At a time like this, you should respond
with a meaningful expression or something.

171
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,750
Why don't you try copying me? Come on.

172
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,627
A meaningful look.

173
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,630
Yeah, like that. Good. Smile wider.

174
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,342
Together with your eyes. Your eyes--

175
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,385
Damn it.

176
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,570
Right, it's over there.

177
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,090
Is this your friend's place?

178
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,719
He's more like a brother than a friend.

179
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,556
I'm like the reliable older brother.
He's like the wimpy little brother.

180
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,266
Here. Unit 402.

181
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:41,737
Ki-seok was a weak little bastard,
so he always got beaten up by other kids.

182
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,948
And I often saved him.

183
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,535
- That was nice of you.
- What is this?

184
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,495
Is that really Ki-seok?

185
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,004
But why did we come here?

186
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,217
Hey, I'm exhausted too. Okay?

187
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,388
I want to rest and charge my phone.

188
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,936
And most importantly,
we need money since we're on the run.

189
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,442
Hey, Ki-seok.

190
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,361
Yeah, I'm at your place.

191
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:23,863
Yeah.

192
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,031
On your way back,

193
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,077
withdraw like 1.5 million,
no, bring 2 million won.

194
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,122
It's a long story.

195
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,376
I want to join a gym, okay?

196
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,712
Bring the money I asked for.

197
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,217
Hey, you should rest too.

198
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,516
When we get the money from Ki-seok,

199
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,395
let's run away
to somewhere remote and lie low.

200
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,900
I'm not running away.

201
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,236
Why not?

202
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,656
You plan on fighting them?

203
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,325
I have to tell them.

204
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,452
Tell them what?

205
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,331
A lot of the cops are probably monsters.

206
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:16,916
Who will you tell?

207
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,709
That woman.

208
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,921
We have to make her trust us.

209
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,047
You've lost it.

210
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,844
This doesn't concern you,
so you can run away or whatever.

211
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,141
You're driving me crazy.

212
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,063
<i>Time is running out, everyone.
You need to...</i>

213
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,024
{\an8}<i>A clash broke out on a highway
in Namil-gun yesterday</i>

214
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,735
{\an8}<i>between the police
and unidentified monstrous creatures.</i>

215
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,987
{\an8}<i>As numerous citizens witnessed the scene,</i>

216
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,406
{\an8}<i>videos of the incident
are spreading rapidly</i>

217
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:53,118
{\an8}<i>on social media
and various online portals.</i>

218
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,663
{\an8}<i>The police have issued a statement
about the incident,</i>

219
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,499
{\an8}<i>emphasizing
that it will be resolved promptly.</i>

220
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,378
{\an8}<i>Currently, the police know
almost everything there is to know</i>

221
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,838
{\an8}<i>about the reported monstrous creatures,</i>

222
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:08,008
{\an8}<i>and are in the process of exterminating
a significant number of them.</i>

223
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,219
{\an8}<i>In order to minimize social chaos,</i>

224
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,680
{\an8}<i>we'd been carrying out the operation
in secret.</i>

225
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,556
{\an8}<i>We apologize for that.</i>

226
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,769
{\an8}<i>We are now switching our response strategy</i>

227
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,479
{\an8}<i>to an open investigation.</i>

228
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,357
{\an8}<i>We promise to eradicate them
completely and permanently</i>

229
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,401
{\an8}<i>through a large-scale clean-up operation</i>

230
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,195
{\an8}<i>with the cooperation and information
provided by the public.</i>

231
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,655
Look at that.

232
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,200
How do we even know
whether that cop is a monster or not?

233
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,037
So, what are you planning to tell them?

234
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,841
- We will look into it.
- Confirming right now.

235
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,759
I'd like to confirm the location again.

236
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,261
May I please have your name?

237
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,430
Yes, understood.

238
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,312
Excuse me, Captain Choi.

239
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,480
May I help you?

240
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,150
We've received a report.

241
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,652
Something was sighted
near the outskirts of Namil-gun.

242
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,530
I think it might be their hideout.

243
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,033
Reports are pouring in right now.

244
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,910
Was there any critical information
worth our attention?

245
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,622
Has this information been made public too?

246
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,296
This information came in
before the police announcement.

247
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,298
We sent in a team to investigate it.

248
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,550
<i>Our team confirmed</i>

249
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,637
<i>that people are gathering in the warehouse
with that symbol on its door.</i>

250
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,767
<i>It's been reported that
about 20 people have gathered so far.</i>

251
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,560
<i>After withdrawing from Saejin Church,</i>

252
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,396
it seems they've been using this place
as their base.

253
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:50,069
I'm sure they know we're concentrating
our efforts on Namil-gun.

254
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,238
So why wouldn't they leave this area?

255
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,450
They must have decided
it would be better not to move rashly.

256
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,785
Yes, I agree.

257
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,413
Checkpoints and searches
have been reinforced on major roads,

258
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,498
so that could be it.

259
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,042
Hiding right under our noses on purpose.

260
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,504
I doubt they're that savvy.

261
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:15,135
Captain Choi,
they're more capable than you think.

262
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,097
They're quick learners
who analyzed humanity

263
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,350
and then used a religious organization
to stay off the radar.

264
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,685
I think you're underestimating them.

265
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,313
The governor of Namil-gun and the citizens

266
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,191
are calling for a swift resolution
to the situation.

267
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,860
Please make your decision quickly.

268
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,784
Let's launch the clean-up operation
at sunrise tomorrow.

269
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,326
It's none of my business.

270
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,403
Hello?

271
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,782
Jeong Su-in?

272
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,411
<i>You're the woman
who's trying to catch me, right?</i>

273
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,580
So it is you, Su-in.

274
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,374
Where are you right now?

275
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,667
<i>First, listen to me.</i>

276
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,839
<i>There are parasites
among the police where you are.</i>

277
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,133
Okay, sure.

278
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,760
<i>Mr. Chul-min</i>

279
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,263
<i>and his detective partner
are both parasites.</i>

280
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,725
I see. But you know what?

281
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,188
We have this thing called
a physical security exam.

282
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,400
You need to pass that exam
to get an access card.

283
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,403
<i>Whatever that is,
you can just examine them again.</i>

284
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,990
If what you're saying is true,

285
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,451
why don't you help me?

286
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,079
That will make things much easier.

287
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,668
In any case,
you want to get rid of them too, right?

288
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,465
Why don't we meet up in person and talk?

289
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,387
<i>Gukil Café in Shingwan-dong,</i>

290
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:04,930
<i>Jinyang-si.</i>

291
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,821
You're listening, right?

292
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,991
Let me make myself clear.

293
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,202
I'm not running away, no matter what.

294
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,472
What the heck, man?

295
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,310
Look at the time. Why are you so late?

296
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:53,937
Hey.

297
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,897
What's going on?

298
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,359
What mess did you
get yourself into this time?

299
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,362
I saved the world for a brief moment.

300
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,033
Anyway, thanks for this.
I'll pay you back. Thank you.

301
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,534
Forget it, man.

302
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,537
By the way, you met with Jin-hee, right?

303
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:12,873
Jin-hee?

304
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,668
She called me out of the blue recently
and asked for your number.

305
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,420
When was that?

306
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,088
About two weeks ago?

307
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,633
I'm not sure, but anyway,
I hadn't heard from you either,

308
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,385
so I told her to send you a DM.

309
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,222
And I said you might check it later
if she sent you a message.

310
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,061
MESSAGE SAVED, 15 DAYS AGO

311
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,729
{\an8}SEND A MESSAGE TO SEOL KANG-WOO

312
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,733
DON'T COME HOME, NO MATTER...

313
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,738
DON'T COME HOME, NO MATTER

314
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,743
<i>Do you know why you got betrayed
by your gang and are on the run now?</i>

315
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,329
Because you're a goddamn coward.

316
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,246
Right?

317
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,291
You said the monsters killed
your little sister,

318
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,377
and your older sister became one.

319
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,921
<i>Now Su-in, who saved your life,
is about to die.</i>

320
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,090
And you're running away?

321
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,343
Sure, that's who you are,
a goddamn coward.

322
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,352
Fuck. I'm totally gonna get screwed.

323
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,771
What do you mean?

324
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,192
Hey, I need to go downtown.
Let me borrow your car.

325
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,204
Welcome.

326
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,129
Did you happen to see a young woman here?

327
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,547
She looks like this.

328
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,758
Oh, she said
she'd be waiting on the rooftop.

329
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,388
Excuse me. She said you have her wallet.

330
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,016
And that you'd pay
for her coffee, 5,000 won.

331
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,698
Jeong Su-in!

332
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,575
Where are you?

333
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,327
Su-in!

334
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,289
Where are you?

335
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,375
Su-in!

336
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:22,961
Jeong Su-in!

337
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,134
What?

338
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,179
You thought I'd bring the police again?

339
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,722
I had to be prepared.

340
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,933
Smart move.

341
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,854
If you try to pull anything stupid,
then Heidi will take over.

342
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,647
Heidi?

343
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,320
So, what you're trying to say is

344
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,780
that you're still a human right now.

345
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,408
And the parasite...
No. What did you call it? Heidi?

346
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,494
So, you and that coexist. Is that it?

347
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,496
Simply put, yes.

348
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,499
Okay, sure.

349
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,461
What were you trying to say earlier?

350
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,795
It's exactly as you heard.

351
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:09,132
Mr. Chul-min and his detective partner
are both parasites.

352
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,845
Let's say you can make that claim
against Detective Kang.

353
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:18,683
But Detective Kim has tried
to protect you until the very end.

354
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,353
So, why are you saying this now?

355
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,689
Mr. Chul-min...

356
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,152
died.

357
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,863
Right in front of my eyes.

358
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,657
What?

359
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,326
He was trying to protect me.

360
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,289
But the pastor Kang Won-seok brought along
cut off his head.

361
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,710
And that bastard took over his body
and is pretending to be him!

362
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,379
Why won't you believe me?

363
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,512
Actually, someone reported today
that they found the parasites' hideout.

364
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,139
The two people you mentioned.

365
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:02,686
Detectives Kim and Kang insisted
on a large-scale clean-up operation.

366
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,397
If what you're saying is true,

367
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:10,694
then that means they're impostors
trying to sabotage our operations.

368
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,488
Why would they suggest such a thing?

369
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,199
It's obvious! It's a trap!

370
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,494
If you guys go there,
you'll all be killed by them.

371
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,706
There's one way to find out.

372
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,584
You come with us.

373
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,335
"Us"?

374
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,216
If you're truly on our side,

375
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,928
you can come with us
and find out if it's a trap or not, right?

376
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,809
We don't want
any physical conflict either.

377
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,769
So, will you cooperate with us?

378
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,689
Can you convince Heidi?

379
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,441
If you can communicate with that.

380
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,358
Okay?

381
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,448
Get her!

382
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,119
Damn it! Jeong Su-in!

383
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,207
What was that?

384
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,268
Hey, it's me! Get in!

385
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,658
Split up and find her.

386
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,742
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes.

387
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,621
Damn it. Where did she run off to?

388
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,173
Your friend

389
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,968
is doing something
incredibly dangerous right now.

390
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,098
Tell her that it does not help
in our survival at all.

391
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,977
Su-in is doing her damn best
to survive right now.

392
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,273
I do not understand what you are saying.

393
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,613
Sure, to you guys, survival means
just being alive and breathing, right?

394
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,824
But it's different for humans.

395
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,741
For humans,

396
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,744
survival means living among people.

397
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,539
But Su-in can't do anything right now.

398
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,165
So,

399
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,584
in order to survive,

400
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,547
she's trying
to get more people to trust her.

401
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,135
That's the survival method she's chosen.

402
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,060
Even if that is the survival method
she has chosen,

403
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,105
do not let her engage

404
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,357
in anything dangerous
for the next three hours.

405
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,985
Why?

406
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,155
Since yesterday, I've taken over
her consciousness for too long.

407
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,533
For at least the next three hours,

408
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,077
I have no choice
but to be completely asleep.

409
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,540
No matter what happens,
I will not be able to help.

410
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,002
- Okay.
- I'm seriously warning you.

411
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,046
Do not engage in anything dangerous.

412
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,132
Then...

413
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,053
She always gets the last word.

414
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,390
<i>After the police announcement</i>

415
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,976
<i>confirming the existence
of monstrous creatures</i>

416
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,979
<i>known as parasites,
which had only been believed to be rumors,</i>

417
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,608
<i>other related instances and videos
that had been circulating on the internet...</i>

418
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,567
What the hell?

419
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,068
<i>...have been proven to be true.</i>

420
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,863
<i>Many citizens
have been expressing their anxiety</i>

421
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,157
<i>on social media and various online portals</i>

422
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,493
<i>since the announcement was made.</i>

423
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,452
My goodness.

424
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,828
<i>In particular, some reports...</i>

425
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,331
Seriously, even crazy stuff
like this is happening.

426
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,833
Kang-woo?

427
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,669
If you wrecked my car, you're dead meat.

428
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,676
Kyung-hee?

429
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,805
Kang-woo went out.

430
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,229
What?

431
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,606
Good morning.

432
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,945
Hey, Heidi said she has no energy left
and has to sleep for the next three hours,

433
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,739
so don't do anything dangerous
for three hours.

434
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,159
Righteous defender,
contain your enthusiasm a bit.

435
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,879
I'm almost there.
Don't worry. I won't crash your car.

436
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,799
<i>Hey, hurry up. Your sister is here.</i>

437
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,513
- What?
- He said he'll be back soon.

438
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,350
By the way, why don't you have a seat?

439
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,271
- Ki-seok, is she next to you?
- <i>Yes.</i>

440
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,607
Listen. Just give her some excuse
and get out of there.

441
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,609
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

442
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,573
Look, that's not my sister.
Get out of there quickly.

443
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,659
What are you talking about?
Just get your ass here quickly.

444
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,213
You are with our kin right now, right?

445
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,425
I will give you 15 minutes.

446
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,887
Bring my kin with you.

447
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:34,267
<i>If you do not come in 15 minutes,
your friend will be decapitated.</i>

448
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,689
It's me they're after,

449
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,899
so let's go.

450
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,860
Didn't you hear what Heidi said?

451
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,571
She won't be able to do anything
for three hours.

452
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,781
They won't know Heidi is asleep.

453
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,159
They'll just think I'm one of them.

454
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,121
They seem to sense each other
through some kind of feeling.

455
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,165
They'll just think I'm one of them too.

456
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,628
What's your plan?
What if they still kill you?

457
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,883
Right now, it's important for them
to have more support on their side.

458
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,845
So I'll pretend to cooperate with them
to buy us three hours.

459
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,390
Okay?

460
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,434
Are you just gonna let your friend die?

461
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,105
Come on, let's go.

462
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,013
I came as you asked.

463
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,682
Let the human go.

464
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,268
I am one of your kin.

465
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,729
I want to be on your side.

466
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,940
You are amusing.

467
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,193
I can barely feel your brain waves.

468
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,696
Are you asleep inside that human?

469
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,447
What?

470
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,575
I already know
the police ran tests on you.

471
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,087
Our kin inside of that human...

472
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,093
can you still hear me
even though you are asleep?

473
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,057
Although I am curious why you could not
fully take over that human's brain,

474
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,561
you are a threat to our kin...

475
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,772
so I must kill you.

476
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,234
We do not need a mutant like you.

477
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,030
I heard you are quite powerful.

478
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,867
If you want to protect your host,

479
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,620
you need to fight me right now and win.

480
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,168
Get down!

481
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,337
Ki-seok, come out now!

482
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,135
Ki-seok!

483
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,263
Come on, get out quickly!

484
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,475
Ki-seok!

485
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,812
You idiot, what are you doing?

486
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,439
Hey! Let's go!

487
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,232
You're gonna get killed too!

488
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,192
Ki-seok!

489
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,198
Come on, we have to go!

490
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,283
Hurry!

491
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,080
Hey, get in!

492
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,314
I'm gonna kill them!
I'll never forgive them!

493
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:31,129
We currently have four undercover teams
monitoring the area around their hideout.

494
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,672
Our team is ready to go.

495
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,383
- Then we'll get ready to move out.
- Okay.

496
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,972
When our strike team moves in,
will you be joining us?

497
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,768
We will barricade the surrounding area
and prepare for any contingencies.

498
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,895
Is there a problem?

499
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:51,899
No.

500
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,026
Let's go.

501
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:39,197
This will likely be
Team Grey's last operation in our region.

502
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,534
Perhaps. I guess
we'll have to see today's result.

503
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,339
Please go ahead first. I forgot something.

504
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,759
Nothing to note.

505
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,558
Captain Choi.

506
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,980
We've evacuated the area
and started to close off the roads.

507
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,149
Oh, and we're ready to go too.

508
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,902
Okay. Please stand by.

509
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,257
- Which one is it this time?
- <i>Listen carefully.</i>

510
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,010
The clean-up operation you're about to do,

511
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,177
it's a trap.

512
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,096
<i>And who is this?</i>

513
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,890
Is this Seol Kang-woo
of the Mangnani Gang?

514
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,351
<i>It is you.</i>

515
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,062
Is Jeong Su-in with you?

516
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,273
Yes.

517
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,110
The clean-up operation is a trap,
so stop it.

518
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,489
Okay, but the thing is,
that's easier said than done.

519
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:50,661
The people of Namil-gun are serious
about the Korean Folk Music Festival.

520
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,747
They all want the parasites
quickly destroyed

521
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,041
so that they can proceed
with the festival.

522
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,792
<i>I know it's ridiculous.</i>

523
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,754
What kind of bullshit is that?

524
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,797
Forget the festival.
Do you all want to die?

525
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,842
<i>I've already told you
that you have monster cops.</i>

526
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,177
Okay.

527
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:11,557
But you know, it turned out the detectives
Jeong Su-in mentioned aren't parasites.

528
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,018
No way.

529
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,729
You sure you checked them both properly?

530
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,314
I didn't check them both.

531
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,608
But Detective Kang
is definitely not a parasite.

532
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,525
<i>What?</i>

533
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,194
<i>That bastard partner cop,</i>

534
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,113
he's the one that killed your monster,

535
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,699
<i>the one in the iron mask.</i>

536
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,453
I saw him kill that monster
with some strange iron knife.

537
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,081
Why did he use an iron knife?

538
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,000
<i>Anyway, even if that detective
isn't a monster,</i>

539
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,835
<i>he's definitely on their side.</i>

540
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,672
Record this call starting now.

541
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,634
<i>If this operation is a trap,</i>

542
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,886
then I'll be killed once I go in there.

543
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,679
If that happens, take the recording

544
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,307
to the Superintendent General
at the National Police Agency.

545
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,727
<i>- We're ready to enter, ma'am.
- Proceed.</i>

546
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,521
<i>Lead Group, enter!</i>

547
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,107
<i>Lead Group, moving to the strike point.</i>

548
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:11,992
Entering now!

549
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,745
Target found!

550
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,039
<i>Engage!</i>

551
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,041
Push! Split!

552
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,087
Runner, nine o'clock!

553
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,133
- Terminated!
- Look up!

554
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,939
<i>All Grey units, enter the building
and support the Lead Group.</i>

555
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,693
<i>Eliminate all threats in the way.
Zero exceptions!</i>

556
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:14,805
You may pass.

557
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,725
Go ahead and pass.

558
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,538
Hey, what are you doing?

559
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,041
There are too many people here.

560
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,876
Traditionally,

561
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,713
festivals are more fun
when there are a lot of guests, okay?

562
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,507
No need to scare them off so soon.

563
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,190
Is this the emotion that...

564
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,777
humans call "betrayal"?

565
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,663
What are these bastards doing?

566
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,580
<i>Kill confirmed.</i>

567
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,418
All targets eliminated.

568
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,754
Did you hear that?

569
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,966
The clean-up operation was a success.

570
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,676
As far as I know,

571
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,053
you're the only parasite left
in the region,

572
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,555
<i>Jeong Su-in.</i>

573
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:41,767
Damn it.

574
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,895
What is this? I really don't understand.

575
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,106
What about what we saw?

576
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,066
But the situation there...

577
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:55,864
How am I supposed to make sense of that?
Why are they killing each other?

578
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,496
FOLK MUSIC FESTIVAL TO CELEBRATE
OPENING CHOI YONG-JAE MEMORIAL HALL

579
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,166
As someone who got backstabbed hard
by his own gang, I can tell you.

580
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,213
You said that monster switched over
to your detective friend's body, right?

581
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,841
But what if

582
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,012
that monster isn't simply trying
to take over another human brain

583
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,391
but the brain of someone
who's the head of a human organization?

584
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,311
What?

585
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,063
He's going after the mayor's brain.

586
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:40,284
