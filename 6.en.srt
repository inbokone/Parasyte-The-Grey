1
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,601
Damn it.

2
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,228
Oh, Deacon Kang!

3
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,605
Come on, that was a pretty nice shot.

4
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:29,154
I want to play a round of golf with you,
but I don't seem to be getting any better.

5
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,656
Come on, you can just come.

6
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,074
Are you signing Ju-eun up

7
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,577
for a language study abroad program
during the break?

8
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:36,911
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,164
She's still quite young.

10
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,791
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,086
Kids pick up languages better
when they are younger.

12
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,171
You're right.

13
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,590
Actually, I'm quite worried.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,176
What if they're already falling behind?

15
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:55,472
I'm worried our kids might end up like us
if we do nothing and--

16
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,016
Enough. You're embarrassing us
in front of the deacons.

17
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,225
But it's true.

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,146
Your career has no future,
and a cop's salary is clear-cut.

19
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,523
I don't see you getting promoted
any time soon.

20
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,110
Well, if we all pray hard together,

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,279
perhaps a miracle will occur.

22
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,031
Amen to that.

23
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,951
- Yes.
- Well, now that we're on the subject.

24
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,952
It's our pastor,

25
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,580
he didn't come to service last week.

26
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,540
Have you heard anything?

27
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,459
Well, I'm not sure.

28
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,461
I heard from the hair salon

29
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,423
that the pastor's wife looked
quite anxious for some reason.

30
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,761
I haven't been able to get in touch
with her recently, so I'm a bit worried.

31
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,224
I'll stop by to check in on them
when I'm out on patrol later.

32
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,141
Don't worry.

33
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,476
- Thank you.
- Sure.

34
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,479
Where do kids go for language learning?

35
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,272
Lately, Canada is...

36
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:15,927
<i>Korean tidal flats.</i>

37
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,888
<i>Recently, interest in tidal flats
is increasing</i>

38
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,890
<i>as they are known to absorb carbon.</i>

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,519
<i>The academic world calls tidal flats
a blue carbon ecosystem</i>

40
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,646
<i>because they reduce greenhouse gases.</i>

41
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,564
<i>Today we will...</i>

42
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,481
Pastor Kwon.

43
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,529
You were home, Pastor.

44
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,408
<i>We have with us Professor Yoon Ji-hong
from Hankuk University.</i>

45
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,368
<i>Hello. I'm Yoon Ji-hong.</i>

46
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,036
<i>Professor Yoon.</i>

47
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,371
<i>As mentioned earlier,</i>

48
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,374
<i>certain conditions must exist
for the tidal flats in Korea,</i>

49
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,253
<i>designated as UNESCO sites, to be formed.
What's your opinion?</i>

50
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,462
Pastor Kwon?

51
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,883
<i>First, in order for tidal flats to form,</i>

52
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,135
<i>it is often said</i>

53
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:01,931
<i>that at least three
oceanographic conditions must be met.</i>

54
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,516
Excuse me for a moment.

55
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,121
Pastor Kwon.

56
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,217
Oh, my God! What is this? What...

57
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,056
Are you the police?

58
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,224
What is this?

59
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:53,650
Our species was born
with one command to follow.

60
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,652
"Eat

61
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,403
humans."

62
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:02,784
So, I did some research on humans
and the human world.

63
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,372
But unlike other species,

64
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,250
humans survive using

65
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,752
a very interesting method.

66
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,880
You do not need to be afraid.

67
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,427
I will make a proposal to you.

68
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,054
I do not believe

69
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,391
it will be a bad deal for you either.

70
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,310
If you do not accept,

71
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,646
you will

72
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,898
die here too.

73
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,029
I...

74
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,450
do not wish to take over just one human

75
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,245
but to become the head
of a human organization.

76
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,790
As the head of a human organization,

77
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,500
I want to parasitize

78
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,837
that organization.

79
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,103
What is it with your awkward smile?

80
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,023
Is this not the time
to have a serious look?

81
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,234
As expected, you adapt quickly.

82
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,236
By the way,

83
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,906
if our plan succeeds...

84
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,786
shouldn't I at least become an assemblyman

85
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,330
to properly assist you?

86
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,417
You can become anything you want.

87
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,755
We will soon control
the human organization.

88
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,652
SPECIAL PRESS CONFERENCE
ON THE PARASITES IN NAMIL-GUN

89
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,949
Hello.

90
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,411
I am Kim Chul-min,
Captain of Violent Crimes Team 3.

91
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,331
Today, I would like to update you

92
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,792
on our parasite investigation.

93
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,253
Recently, we executed

94
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,466
a large-scale clean-up operation
with the parasite task force.

95
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,052
As a result, we were able to eradicate

96
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,764
almost all the parasites in our region.

97
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,266
However, we have determined

98
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,228
that some survived
and are still hiding in the area.

99
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:41,234
While the Korean Folk Music Festival
will proceed as scheduled,

100
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,904
as mentioned earlier,
we urge the public to remain vigilant

101
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:49,450
until the parasites
are eradicated completely.

102
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,747
Next, it was decided today

103
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,251
by the Personal Information
Disclosure Committee to make

104
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,420
this personal information public.

105
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,881
<i>Jeong Su-in, 29 years old.</i>

106
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,218
<i>Seol Kyung-hee, 45 years old.</i>

107
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,347
<i>They are both residents of Namil-gun</i>,

108
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,142
<i>female, and around 160 centimeters tall</i>.

109
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,436
<i>The two women pictured here...</i>

110
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,603
That'll be 6,800 won.

111
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,355
<i>...are extremely dangerous parasites.</i>

112
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:24,360
<i>If you encounter them
or see anyone with strange behavior,</i>

113
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,156
<i>please send in a tip or report it
immediately to the Namil Police Station</i>

114
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,075
<i>or the parasite task force at the NPA.</i>

115
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,912
<i>This information will be available
on the NPA website</i>

116
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,373
<i>so that all citizens have access to it.</i>

117
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,920
<i>Once again,
we ask the public and the media</i>

118
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,591
<i>for your cooperation and to provide
any information you may have.</i>

119
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,552
Everyone knows what you look like now.
Let's be careful.

120
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,389
But why are they taking
such drastic measures?

121
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,601
The mayor is coming
to the Korean Folk Music Festival.

122
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:01,022
If Heidi and that monster show up as well,
things will get really messy.

123
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,233
So it will try to switch over
to the mayor's body then.

124
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,113
KYUNG-HEE

125
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,536
Hello?

126
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,455
It is your sister.

127
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,584
You crazy shit.
Don't you say those words to me!

128
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:22,960
<i>Let us meet.</i>

129
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,796
You think I've lost my mind?
Why would I meet you?

130
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,467
Tell this to my kin that you are with,

131
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,677
who I believe will understand.

132
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,012
Fuck off.

133
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,641
It's me.

134
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,810
<i>You must know you and I are
in the same boat if you saw the news.</i>

135
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,021
Let us meet at once.

136
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,274
I will be waiting
at Cheongil Botanical Garden.

137
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,196
Are you really going to meet her?

138
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,741
The monster that killed Mr. Chul-min

139
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,203
is now trying to become
the mayor of a big city.

140
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,416
So what?
What can the two of us actually do?

141
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,169
That's exactly why we need
more people on our side.

142
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,595
PARASYTE: THE GREY

143
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:03,811
Good work.

144
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,354
Thank you.

145
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,904
Well, that was a good briefing.

146
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,865
Oh, thank you.

147
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,160
I think it went well, just as we agreed.

148
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,286
Is there a problem?

149
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,747
No, I wouldn't say it's a problem.

150
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,876
I mean, you put in so much effort
to protect Jeong Su-in this whole time.

151
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,547
But today, it seems like
you've had a change of heart.

152
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,383
Is that what you think?

153
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,846
The safety of the public should come
before any personal feelings, right?

154
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,556
Really?

155
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,517
When we raided Saejin Church,
not long ago,

156
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,312
you found something
that belonged to her, didn't you?

157
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,065
The thing you hid in your pocket.

158
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,902
Then you met her at that theme park
to confirm if it was hers.

159
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,321
What was the item?

160
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,161
Does that really matter right now?

161
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,419
Whether you're trying to deny it

162
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,506
or not remembering it at all,

163
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,466
I can't really tell.

164
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,430
He's very soft-hearted, you know?

165
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,391
We have to get going now, okay?

166
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,476
Let's go.

167
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,440
That one is suspicious of me.

168
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,526
Let's get rid of it now.

169
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,362
- We need to make it look natural.
- How?

170
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,824
With the method humans use.

171
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,076
By utilizing an organization.

172
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,005
Is this the right place?
You agreed to meet here?

173
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,425
I can sense it.

174
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,385
It's further inside.

175
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,055
Why here, of all places?

176
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,978
You know it'll be a disaster
if Heidi and that thing fight.

177
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,688
She will know that too.

178
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,523
Damn, you startled me.

179
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,150
You stay here.

180
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,776
Why?

181
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:19,697
Your thirst for revenge
makes you a liability right now.

182
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,682
Why did you ask to meet?

183
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,519
To punish the one who betrayed our kin.

184
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,315
The one that jumped from Pastor Kwon
to Detective Kim Chul-min.

185
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,317
I must kill him.

186
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,780
Did you not understand
when he went on the news to provoke us?

187
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,907
It is an obvious trap.

188
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,659
He is trying to drag us into a scheme.

189
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,454
It does not matter.

190
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,542
I am going to kill him.

191
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,171
But he is already parasitizing
a human organization.

192
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,633
Organizations are truly amazing.

193
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,596
A single creature may be weak,

194
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,476
but an organization formed by many of them
is highly resilient and powerful.

195
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,355
He understood this.

196
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,690
Are you asking me for help?

197
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,445
The owner of this body may agree,
but I do not.

198
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,826
You want to kill him too, do you not?

199
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,955
It is an irrational choice
that goes against survival.

200
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,293
Survival?

201
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,964
Is survival all that matters to you?

202
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,896
Look at this man.

203
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,525
He came at me
even though he knew that he could die.

204
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,610
It was definitely not a rational choice.

205
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,406
But I can now understand
what this man is feeling.

206
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,826
I came to understand it
when our kin was killed by him.

207
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,871
Damn it, how dare you say
that you understand me!

208
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,999
We can neither live independently

209
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,918
nor preserve our species
through reproduction.

210
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,673
The only thing we can do
is parasitize humans and eat them.

211
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,468
It's your fault for being born a parasite.

212
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,768
What's wrong with him?

213
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,312
That is right.

214
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,523
We were not given a choice,

215
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,442
so we had to ask this question.

216
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,322
"What is the reason for our existence?"

217
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,826
Then one of our kin answered.

218
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,705
That we must protect each other.

219
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,876
That we must be able
to rely on each other.

220
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,881
And that we must create
an organization and survive together.

221
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,843
The one who gave us
the meaning of our existence...

222
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,181
is the one I want to kill.

223
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,141
Don't be an idiot.

224
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,102
The bastards who say that kind of stuff

225
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,105
are the first to backstab others
for their own survival.

226
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,193
Do you know what he is after?

227
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,569
Do you want to know?

228
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,404
The festival is happening tomorrow.

229
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,782
The mayor of Namcheon
will be attending. Okay?

230
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,242
I'm sure that bastard is after
the mayor's head.

231
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,287
If he takes over the mayor's brain,

232
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,166
it will be more difficult
for the two of you to survive.

233
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,586
In the end, you will be killed by humans.

234
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,630
What will the both of you do?

235
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,549
We're going to kill that bastard

236
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,635
before he has a chance to kill the mayor.

237
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,095
And the next to die

238
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,222
will be you, got it?

239
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,684
I'm gonna tear that fucking head of yours
from my sister's body.

240
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,312
The latter part of your plan
will not go as you wish,

241
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,400
but until then, we have the same goal.

242
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,875
{\an8}OPENING CEREMONY OF CHOI YONG-JAE
MEMORIAL HALL, A CIVILIAN ARMY LEADER

243
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,406
Did the results I requested come out yet?

244
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,244
Okay, I'll be right there.

245
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,583
This is the autopsy image
of Hunting Dog Number One.

246
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,334
And this is an image

247
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,129
of a weapon that
the parasites transform their bodies into

248
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,256
that was seen in various cases.

249
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,885
Did you check to see
if it can be reproduced in a similar way?

250
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,472
We made a similar cross-section
with a kitchen knife

251
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,599
and tried to recreate a cut on the neck.

252
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,809
It did make a similar pattern.

253
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,396
So, you're saying it's possible
to use a purposely crafted weapon

254
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,691
to manipulate it
as if a parasite did the killing, right?

255
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,945
Yes, unfortunately,
it's a point we overlooked.

256
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,782
But it's definitely possible
that it was manipulated.

257
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,493
Should we reinvestigate the case?

258
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,370
No.

259
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,500
Nothing is certain yet.
Let's keep this to ourselves for now.

260
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,417
Yes, ma'am.

261
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,839
Yes, I'm at the station.

262
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,175
What?

263
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,889
<i>Oh, Captain Choi.</i>

264
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,225
<i>We've received a tip-off.</i>

265
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:25,229
<i>The same symbol found in Saejin Church
was discovered in a church in Gangwon-do.</i>

266
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,397
A tip-off?

267
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,108
When and how did we get the report?

268
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,111
Captain Kim received
an anonymous tip-off this morning

269
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,237
and reported it to HQ.

270
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,446
Captain Kim?

271
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,409
<i>Now that the parasites in Namil-gun
are almost eradicated,</i>

272
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,496
<i>I believe your team should be deployed
to Gangwon-do.</i>

273
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,665
<i>What are your thoughts on this?</i>

274
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,418
Shouldn't we check
if the report is reliable first, sir?

275
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,213
<i>It should be Team Grey
who goes and confirms that.</i>

276
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,756
<i>Right away if possible.</i>

277
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,717
What about the ones remaining here?

278
00:18:55,717 --> 00:19:00,097
{\an8}<i>The local police force
should be able to handle that much.</i>

279
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,810
{\an8}<i>Team Grey should immediately move
to Gangwon-do and begin subjugation there.</i>

280
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,909
The advance party, get ready!

281
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,120
- Go over to that side now.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,122
What are they so busy doing?

283
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,667
They're providing security escort
at the festival. It's for the mayor.

284
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,631
Yes, this is Jeong Su-in's cell phone.

285
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,174
<i>It's me.</i>

286
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,220
<i>Jeong Su-in? Or that monster?</i>

287
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,722
Sure, it is the monster you want to kill.

288
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,893
At this rate, I might grow fond of you.

289
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,561
What do you want?

290
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,105
<i>We made a mistake.</i>

291
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,151
As you said,
Detective Kang is not a parasite.

292
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,654
He is a human

293
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,615
<i>but joined hands with the pastor,
who is their leader.</i>

294
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,577
He killed the Hunting Dog
you cherished so dearly

295
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,249
and helped the pastor transfer himself
to Captain Kim's body.

296
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,337
You said they were both parasites.

297
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,839
But now he's just a traitor?

298
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,094
This came directly from a parasite
who was on the same side as the pastor.

299
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,763
<i>But there is an even bigger problem.</i>

300
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,807
<i>Their ultimate goal</i>

301
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:11,103
is to kill the mayor at the festival
and switch over to his body.

302
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,940
- What?
- <i>Believe what I am saying.</i>

303
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,733
<i>We are going there right now</i>

304
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,443
<i>to kill him.</i>

305
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,531
If we fail, someone else
has to do it and succeed.

306
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,576
<i>So you should also come
and help in killing him.</i>

307
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,505
What did she say? How did she react?

308
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:39,923
Nothing yet.

309
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,886
I will now save my energy for the festival
which will take place soon.

310
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,180
Sure, of course. Go to sleep.

311
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,443
<i>But the pastor Kang Won-seok brought along
cut off his head.</i>

312
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:04,197
And that bastard took over his body
and is pretending to be him!

313
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,532
<i>Why won't you believe me?</i>

314
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,286
Turn the car around.

315
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,997
What? But what about Gangwon-do?

316
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,292
I'll take full responsibility.
Turn around now.

317
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:16,877
Yes, ma'am.

318
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,621
Sir, look over here.

319
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,206
Over here, sir.

320
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,888
Nothing to note so far.

321
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,058
Maybe it's waiting for us
to create a scene.

322
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,268
<i>How is it over there?</i>

323
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,980
It's the same here.

324
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,150
- Should we get going too?
- <i>No.</i>

325
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,319
For now, let's just wait as Heidi said.

326
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,906
If you two come close,
that bastard will notice right away.

327
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,700
Maintain your distance.

328
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,954
Come if something happens.
I'll be monitoring from here.

329
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,249
- Sir, you should try some <i>hotteok</i>.
<i>- </i>  Oh, sure.

330
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,251
This is the most famous shop in Namil-gun.

331
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,168
- Is that so?
- Yes.

332
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,670
- Oh, welcome.
- Hello.

333
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,047
It looks so delicious.

334
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,717
Okay, a big one to-go,
specially for Mr. Mayor.

335
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,262
Here you go.
It's hot, so please be careful.

336
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,765
- Oh God!
- Oh no.

337
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,645
It's quite chewy and delicious.

338
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,190
Is this made with local flour?

339
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,943
- No, it's imported flour.
- What?

340
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,864
But Namil-gun is famous

341
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,158
for making all kinds of food
so deliciously.

342
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,036
- Amazing cooking skills are the specialty!
- Correct.

343
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,163
Yes, cooking skills.

344
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,335
Hey, don't just stand here.

345
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,921
Go check where he's going next
and wait there. Hurry up.

346
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,964
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

347
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,803
Is this necessary?

348
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,098
Even if human cops are there,

349
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:39,311
if Heidi and I attack him together,
we should be able to get rid of him.

350
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,358
Heidi is not cautious
because she is afraid...

351
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,904
but because of me.

352
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,864
She doesn't want me in danger.

353
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,826
She was so unlucky.

354
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,456
Out of all the people out there,
she came inside of me while I was dying.

355
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,335
That's why
she couldn't fully take over me.

356
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,006
She had to save me first
in order for her to live.

357
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,219
So, in the end,
she became an incomplete being

358
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,431
who can only use her strength
for 10 to 15 minutes at a time.

359
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:22,771
She can't transfer herself
into another body like you or the others.

360
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,815
So,

361
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,568
that is why she is powerful.

362
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,487
What?

363
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:35,534
Generally, when our kin first takes over
a human body and is able to control it,

364
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,953
we no longer consider that body
a part of ourselves.

365
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,957
It is similar to humans driving a car.

366
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,418
If it breaks, though inconvenient,
you can throw it away.

367
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,880
But Heidi could not do that.

368
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,008
She had to protect a part of herself.

369
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,136
That is why Heidi had to be strong

370
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,556
and always fought so desperately

371
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,975
in order to protect you.

372
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:09,859
It's on the move.

373
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,361
What? Where?

374
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,843
Mr. Mayor! This way!

375
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,777
<i>Enter the festival grounds now.</i>

376
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,695
Move!

377
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,881
Go to the mayor.

378
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,965
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes.

379
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,368
Have they lost their fucking minds?

380
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,082
Come on, evacuate now!

381
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,208
Quick! Get up.

382
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,880
Hey, they're taking the mayor
into a building, okay?

383
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,632
Get over here quickly. Oh fuck.

384
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,432
Jeong Su-in, it's time to surrender!

385
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,934
Come out!

386
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,354
I will take care of that woman.
You go ahead.

387
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,566
Good. Do as we say now.

388
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,611
Damn it.

389
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,307
Do you really need to kill me?

390
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,187
Our goal is simply to live.

391
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:56,401
I do not want to hurt anyone,
including you.

392
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:58,903
The choice is yours.

393
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,206
Over here.

394
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,138
What the hell?

395
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,265
The head is missing.

396
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,189
Where?

397
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,566
The back parking lot? Got it.

398
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,110
There's a car waiting for you, sir.

399
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,864
The back parking lot.

400
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,928
What the hell?

401
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,388
Hey!

402
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,686
We're on your side.

403
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,480
It cannot survive for long without a host.
You take the mayor--

404
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,827
Hey, are you okay?

405
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,604
To you,

406
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,106
I am sorry.

407
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,871
How long can you hold on?

408
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,336
There's no one here

409
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,797
you can transfer yourself to.

410
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:47,882
What do we do?

411
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,092
Where do we have to go?

412
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,053
- Where?
- The back parking lot.

413
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,555
- We need to go there.
- The back?

414
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,147
Hurry up and go!

415
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,737
To the right!

416
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,883
Take him and run quickly.

417
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,554
Heidi, Su-in, I'll come back to get you!

418
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,029
- Hey, hurry up and go!
- Mr. Mayor!

419
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,948
- Are you okay?
- Get him out of here.

420
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,350
Mutant.

421
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,521
When you came to the church,

422
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,983
why did you decide
to side with humans instead of us?

423
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,904
I did not think
you would accept a mutant like me.

424
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,364
What made you think that way?

425
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,161
You were too similar to humans.

426
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,372
Similar to humans, I see.

427
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,126
Yes, you are right.

428
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,548
Neither I nor humans accept
a mutant like you.

429
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,928
But that is what makes
the human organization powerful.

430
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,433
They call the majority normal
and the minority of mutants abnormal.

431
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:11,187
They strengthen the organization
by obtaining the support of the majority.

432
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,147
And the great life form,

433
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,275
called the human organization,
born in this way

434
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:21,530
possesses a power that is incomparable
to a life form that is fragile like us.

435
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:27,328
Human organizations sacrifice
many people for a single purpose.

436
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,334
And after they achieve their goal,

437
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,589
they commemorate the one person
who served as their leader.

438
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,802
As you can see in this memorial hall.

439
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,783
Jeong Su-in!

440
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,956
Heidi.

441
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,167
Su-in.

442
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,336
Goddamn it.

443
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:26,846
Do you remember the command we were given
the moment we were born?

444
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,473
"Take over a human brain."

445
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,809
Maybe it didn't just mean

446
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,396
to take over the physical head of a human

447
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,191
but rather to take over
the head of a great creature

448
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,110
called the human organization.

449
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,250
Join me now.

450
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,086
If we join hands,

451
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:04,050
we will be able to take over
the head of the human organization.

452
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,512
Both of you, freeze.

453
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,482
Shoot her.

454
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,364
Captain Choi, what are you doing?
Shoot her!

455
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,620
If you don't want to lose your head,
shoot her!

456
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,288
Now!

457
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,890
Did you know I was going to shoot him?

458
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,937
No. I do not have the ability
to predict such things.

459
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,442
Then why did you attack him instead of me?

460
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,111
I trusted you.

461
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,075
Jeong Su-in is a strange girl.

462
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,495
She has been hurt
numerous times by humans,

463
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,915
but no matter what,
she does not give up her trust in them.

464
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,002
Instead, she extends
her hand to others first.

465
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,337
That is who she is.

466
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,717
I wanted to copy

467
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,344
her trust in people.

468
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,643
Deep inside, Jeong Su-in longs for people.

469
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,230
She wants to live among people.

470
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,860
Su-in!

471
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,947
Jeong Su-in! Su-in, are you okay?

472
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,034
Please take care of Su-in.

473
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,288
Hey! No.

474
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:44,293
Su-in. Oh, what do I do? Hey, Jeong Su-in!

475
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,920
Hey! What the hell happened?

476
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,338
What the fuck happened?

477
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,964
Su-in, wake up.

478
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,468
Captain.

479
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,763
Take them to the hospital quickly.

480
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,225
Isn't Jeong Su-in a parasite?

481
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,938
Those two are just normal humans.

482
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,890
- What are you <i>mewing</i>?
- What?

483
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,020
I'm working.

484
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,397
When will you be done?

485
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:30,858
In two hours?

486
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:38,115
You're working too hard.
Isn't it tough on you?

487
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,328
What about you? How have you been?

488
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:43,829
Me?

489
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,332
I joined a new organization.

490
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,252
You joined another one
after all you've been through?

491
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,838
It's not like I can start one myself.

492
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,175
I can't be a lone wolf forever.

493
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,802
Besides, the world is a tough place.

494
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,520
Here.

495
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,650
It's impressive, right?

496
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,485
Seol Kang-woo of Team Grey?

497
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,155
Captain Choi got me this entire outfit.

498
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,740
I have insurance now.

499
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,117
Are you jealous?

500
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,495
I thought about it a lot.

501
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,831
But what choice do I have
but to give it another shot?

502
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:31,960
Yeah.

503
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,088
Good for you.

504
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,055
What?

505
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,724
Did you have something to say?

506
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,144
Actually, I received a letter yesterday.

507
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,604
The thing is...

508
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,191
Heidi was the one who sent it.

509
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,612
She could have left it for you herself,

510
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:02,116
but she asked me to read it aloud
for you in a human voice.

511
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:04,952
Here we go.

512
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,621
"Hi, Jeong Su-in."

513
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,458
Okay, I won't joke around.

514
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,587
"This may sound awkward
since this is my first letter,

515
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,047
so please understand."

516
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,134
"I thought about the meaning

517
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:23,095
of our existence
that our kin had talked about."

518
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,348
"I have not come to a conclusion yet,

519
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,685
but I am glad that you are the host

520
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:34,565
that I parasitized and that I failed
to fully take over your brain."

521
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,531
This sentence right here.
You need to read this yourself.

522
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,408
I can't bring myself to read it.

523
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,385
Su-in!

524
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,973
Captain Choi said
she has a spot for you on the team.

525
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,977
Don't be such a loner.
Just give me a call if you wanna join.

526
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,562
See you.

527
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,572
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOU ARE NOT ALONE

528
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,893
So, who is this person?

529
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,729
He says he's an investigative journalist

530
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,483
and claims to be the top expert
when it comes to parasites.

531
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,445
And he says
he has some very important information.

532
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,781
What? Are you sure he's not a nut job?

533
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,755
Thank you for waiting.

534
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:25,425
This is Captain Choi Jun-kyung,
the leader of Team Grey.

535
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,177
Who are you?

536
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,431
Hello, my name is Shinichi Izumi.

537
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:14,302
