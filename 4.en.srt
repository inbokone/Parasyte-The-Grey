WEBVTT

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:14.639
We can see that the parasite organization
that Team Grey has been chasing

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.101
had used Saejin Church
as their base this whole time.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.189
We raided the location based on a tip-off,
but it seems that they have all fled.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.860
However, we believe the leaders
may still be in Namil-gun.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.653 line:20%
<i>Who gave the tip-off?</i>

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.198
Jeong Su-in, 29 years old.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:35.326 line:20%
She is a clerk at a supermarket
near Namil-gun.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.494
"She <i>is</i>"?

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.497
She <i>was</i> a clerk!

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:42.625
Jeong Su-in is no longer a human.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.753
She's a parasite.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.048
I saw it myself and captured her alive.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.174
That's not true.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:56.598
I am Kim Chul-min, Captain
of Violent Crimes Team 3 of Namil Police.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:00.393
Ms. Jeong Su-in is a normal human being.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.855
She's not a monster.
Tests have been conducted on her.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:05.857
You tested her.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.859
Did you not?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.821
Why aren't you reporting the test results?

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.031
Why?

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:15.950
<i>What did the test results show?</i>

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.245
Oh, well, the thing is...

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:26.211 line:20%
We took head X-rays
and conducted a hair test.

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:27.629 line:20%
Based on the results,

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.008 line:20%
she doesn't exhibit any
of the characteristics seen in parasites.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.390
How many times do I have to say
that I saw it myself?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.393
That bitch is definitely a parasite.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:46.231
We still don't know everything
about parasites.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:49.818
Jeong Su-in might be
some kind of a mutant.

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:53.238
Our current methods
of distinguishing parasites

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.324
may not detect everything!

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:57.408
That's ridiculous.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.119
You say you're unsure.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.789
And yet, you put that horrible machine
on a normal person

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.499
and torment her based on uncertainty?

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.251
What if something happens to her?

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:10.046
Who will take responsibility then?
Tell me. Do you not care?

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.632
- So, you decide who the monster is?
- Sir, come on.

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.884
Jeong Su-in is a human. A human!

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:19.139
- <i>Okay, please calm down.</i>
- Seriously.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:22.851
<i>So, what is
Jeong Su-in's current condition?</i>

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.396
She's currently in a coma.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.899
She lost consciousness upon capture,
although there was no physical contact.

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.277
Her brain waves and pulse are very slow.

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:35.071
She's in a coma,
but things could change at any moment,

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:37.198
so she's being held under tight security.

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:39.492
<i>All right. Let's do this.</i>

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.038
<i>We believe it's time to inform the public</i>

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:46.541
<i>about the existence of these parasites.</i>

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:50.128
<i>In order to prevent further social chaos
due to the spread of made-up stories</i>

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:52.589
<i>or unchecked information on the internet,</i>

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.466
<i>we must give the public
a clear picture of these parasites</i>

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.302
<i>and reassure them.</i>

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.345
<i>In order to achieve this,</i>

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.974
<i>Team Grey needs to have
a clear understanding of the parasites</i>

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.935
<i>as well as the ability to contain them.</i>

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:07.854
<i>Do you understand?</i>

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:11.399
<i>First, please transfer Jeong Su-in,
that human, parasite,</i>

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.735
<i>or whatever she is, to the headquarters.</i>

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.362
<i>We'll conduct a more thorough study.</i>

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:19.490
<i>The transfer operation will be led
by Captain Choi Jun-kyung.</i>

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:24.913
<i>And I ask the officers of Namil-gun
to work with Team Grey</i>

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:27.874
<i>and put your best efforts
into eradicating the parasites.</i>

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.878
<i>This is a critical public safety matter.</i>

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:36.841 line:20%
<i>We will send two police tactical units
from the nearest region as support.</i>

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:40.428
<i>Please make the transfer
as soon as you are ready.</i>

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:42.305
<i>Am I clear, Captain Choi?</i>

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.099
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.103
<i>That'll be all.</i>

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:51.814
Thank you, sir.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.666
He called it "a thorough study,"

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.752
but they'll cut open her head
and dissect her at the headquarters.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.170
What if she dies?

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.715
If she does...
she doesn't have any family, right?

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.552
My God, poor thing.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.723
My goodness, that poor thing.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:43.741
Anything unusual?

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.618
No, there's nothing unusual.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.371
Her brain waves and pulse are both normal.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.207
I'll watch her.
You should take a quick break.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.376
Oh? Would that be okay?

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:57.380
Thank you. I'll be right back.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:08.409
PARASYTE: THE GREY

00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:28.888
What is this place?

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.060
This is not reality.

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:37.980
Who are you?

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.110
I am the parasite inside of you.

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:44.362
You two call me Heidi.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:46.489
What?

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:49.409
In real life,
you are in a very dangerous situation.

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:51.744
If you were conscious,

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:55.123
you would have a panic attack,
suffer excruciating pain,

00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:57.917
and probably die soon.

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:01.921
So I cut off your consciousness
from the outside world.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.924
What? Then where am I...?

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.594
We are deep within your mind.

00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:11.347
In your inner thoughts.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:28.406
This may be our first and only chance
to speak face-to-face,

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:33.369
so I brought you to the place
that contains the truth about you.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.954
You're not me.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.540
Don't pretend to be me with my face.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.585
In the end,
you and I have no choice but to coexist.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:44.213
So I thought it'd be best
to talk to you with this face.

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:46.966
If it makes you uncomfortable,
what about this?

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.263
Should we report this?

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:55.766
I don't think
we need to report every little thing.

00:07:55.766 --> 00:07:57.018
She must be dreaming.

00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:58.728
Right?

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.898
<i>Namil Police Station personnel
handling the operation,</i>

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.233
<i>report to the conference room
on the third floor.</i>

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:08.529
- Captain.
- Yeah?

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:12.158
We identified the man we suspect
was with Jeong Su-in last night.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.242
- Really?
- Yes.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:15.369
Okay. I'll be right in.

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:16.787
I'll see you inside, sir.

00:08:16.787 --> 00:08:20.416
<i>The traffic control dispatch schedule
has been updated.</i>

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:22.752
<i>Please check the latest communications.</i>

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:33.846
I have no reason to harm you,
so do not be afraid.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.108
Do you recognize this place?

00:08:48.402 --> 00:08:49.362
Of course I do.

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:51.864
It's my house.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.078
That's my dad.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.874
This is the day
I reported my dad to the police.

00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:08.548
After my mom left us,
he started to take his anger out on me.

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.634
I was beaten every day.

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.011
Over and over.

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.432
Then I reported him.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.602
Because I wanted to live.

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:26.023
This was the day I mustered up the courage

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.277
so I could live.

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:33.698
But...

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.201
people looked at me as if I was a monster.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.831
They couldn't believe
a small child reported her dad.

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.750
That's why I was a monster to them.

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:54.302
Captain.

00:09:56.887 --> 00:09:59.765
His name is Seol Kang-woo.
He has two priors for violent crimes.

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:01.976
The Guro Police Station sent this over.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:05.605
He's a henchman for the Mangnani,
a gang active in the Guro area.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.817
We identified a few gangbangers from Guro
among the bodies found at Saejin Church.

00:10:09.817 --> 00:10:11.777
They might be connected to him.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:14.322
Oh, and according to a detective in Guro,

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.907
there was a power struggle
between the Mangnani in Guro

00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:18.868
and the Cheoli in Yeongdeungpo.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.162
The Mangnani, Seol Kang-woo's gang,

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.831
tried in vain
to kill the Cheoli underboss.

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:27.168
After that, he must've returned
to his hometown, Namil-gun.

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:31.130
He's caused some trouble in the area
over the last few days.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.300
It seems he was made a scapegoat
for peace between the two gangs.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.346
He was such a small fry,
his gang used him and dumped him.

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:39.347
Fucking idiot.

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:43.976
Sir, two taxis drove away
from Changseong Theme Park yesterday.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.812
One went to Cheonggun Apartments,

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:49.398
and the other to the motel district
near Namil Terminal.

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:53.152
The terminal? Wow, such an obvious move.
That bastard should've tried harder.

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:55.571
He might have run off
to another region by now.

00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:58.658
- Should we send guys to the terminal?
- No. I'll go.

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:00.743
What?

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:04.205
By the way,
Team Grey is gonna transfer Su-in today.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.207

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.709
- Understood, sir.
- Oh, the handcuffs.

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:09.669
- Okay.
- Hurry.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.003
- Here, sir.
- Thanks.

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:14.215
- Will you be okay by yourself?
- Don't mention this to Team Grey.

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.508
- Yes, sir.
- Got it, sir.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:52.980
Relax your arm, asshole.

00:12:58.527 --> 00:12:59.403
Damn it.

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.492
You can't just arrest me
without following proper procedure.

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:06.076
What about the "the Fifth" thing?

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.498
Do you even know what that means?

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:14.835
It means you should keep
that fucking mouth shut, you idiot.

00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:16.003
Fine, I'll go.

00:13:16.003 --> 00:13:19.423
But not to your station.
A different one, far from here.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.176
What bullshit are you saying now?

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:25.930
There's a monster at your station.
A monster.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.557
- He's disguising himself as a cop.
- What?

00:13:28.557 --> 00:13:31.727
Remember the monster in the iron mask
at the theme park?

00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:33.312
One of your cops killed him.

00:13:34.438 --> 00:13:36.857
It was a monster
wearing that iron mask, right?

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:40.236
We've already undergone tests.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.447
Save the bullshit, you asshole.

00:13:43.447 --> 00:13:46.867
I guess your fucking tests
don't work. Do they?

00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:48.953
Remember the guy in the raincoat?

00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:51.831
I clearly saw that bastard
stabbing the monster.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.874
- Oh, did you really?
- I'm telling you I did.

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:58.170
Okay. What does he look like? Tell me.

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:00.923
Here, take a look.

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.843
So, is he here?

00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:06.262
Which one? Tell me.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.808
Fuck, it's this one.
This bastard is the monster.

00:14:11.475 --> 00:14:13.602
Wow. It's pretending to be human.
Crazy bastard.

00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:16.897
Holy fuck. It really looks like a human.

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:25.447
Listen carefully.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.868
Tell me everything
that's happened to you and Su-in.

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:31.078
Don't leave a single detail out.

00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:32.580
Got it?

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:45.175
Route 39, right? Got it. Thank you.

00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:46.594
Oh, don't mention it, sir.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.679
Don't go out on a limb. Just stay safe.

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:51.557
When orders are given, I just follow.
I'll get going, sir.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.642
Let's grab a meal sometime, okay?

00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:55.185
- Special forces!
- Special forces.

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:10.701
When will they transfer her?

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:14.288
The transfer will be made
in two hours via Route 39.

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:15.623
Understood.

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.750
<i>I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to.</i>

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.252
How come unexpected incidents
keep happening?

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:24.089
We're still moving forward
with our plan, right?

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.674
Yes.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:27.843
It starts today.

00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:37.705
<i>I begged Mr. Chul-min</i>

00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:40.874
<i>to be able to see my mom just once,</i>

00:16:40.874 --> 00:16:43.085
<i>so he found her address for me.</i>

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.921
<i>I was curious.</i>

00:16:47.464 --> 00:16:49.174
<i>"Wouldn't Mom miss me?"</i>

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.139
<i>"I'm her child, so maybe she missed me."</i>

00:16:57.349 --> 00:17:00.269
She showed so much love
to the other child she gave birth to

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:02.604
while living happily with another man.

00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:06.483
<i>But she looked at me</i>

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.278
<i>as if I were some kind of bug.</i>

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:15.117
<i>How could she be like that?</i>

00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:19.747
<i>I was her child too, so why?</i>

00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:23.709
How could she look at me
with such disgust?

00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:27.337
That's when I realized...

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.800
that I'm just a horrible human being.

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.430
<i>Someone who can't be loved by anyone.</i>

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.939
You can never come here again.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.008
Humans do not judge any object
as an independent entity.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.555
Your mother is judging you
in relation to the environment

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:21.183
in which her husband abused her.

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:25.687
Rather than disliking you
as an individual entity,

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:29.316
her experience in that environment,
which you were also a part of,

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:32.945
makes her believe she dislikes you.

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:37.116
It's not that you were cursed
in particular.

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:38.450
Shut up.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.246
It's just like how a thing like you
invaded my body.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:45.124
It's because I'm such an unlucky bitch

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:47.417
that a monster like you crawled into me.

00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:50.587
Once again,
I was not born out of my own will.

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:53.882
Had you and I not integrated together,

00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:55.592
we both would have died.

00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:57.594
You should have just let me die!

00:18:58.345 --> 00:19:00.514
Why did you have to turn me
into a monster?

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:22.494
So what you're saying is

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:26.331
that Su-in has been infected
by a parasite.

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:27.374
Yes.

00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:30.127
But Su-in's... How should I put this?

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:31.628
Her humanity remains intact.

00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:32.880
- Is that it?
- God.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.465
It's not that her humanity remains.

00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:37.551
Jeong Su-in is still all there.

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.803
She's the main being, but sometimes...

00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:43.390
Okay? Just sometimes, it pops out.
And we call it Heidi.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.433
Heidi pops out.

00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:47.144
And what's Heidi's goal?

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.188
To protect Jeong Su-in.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.273
Why? So it can survive too.

00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:56.403
- Let's talk more at the station.
- Oh, come on.

00:19:58.238 --> 00:20:00.699
I'm telling you,
there's a monster cop at your station.

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:02.409
I'll be dead. That's murder.

00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:26.433
What now?

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:37.778
Su-in will be transferred
to the headquarters today.

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.571
But she'll die if she goes there.

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:42.616
Like you said,
if her consciousness is there,

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:44.243
that means she is human.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:46.662
Then I can't send her there.

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:48.580
Okay. And?

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:50.415
Hey.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.751
Help me out.

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:56.588
I'm getting her out
before she gets transferred.

00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:00.550
- How?
- Listen carefully.

00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:04.137
If you get Su-in out,
I'll protect both of you.

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.723
Okay? Trust me on this.

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:09.476
I'm gonna make a deal with Team Grey.

00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:13.605
As I see it, Team Grey doesn't know
much about the parasites either.

00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:16.733
And the Hunting Dog they used is now dead.

00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:18.068
You said you saw it happen.

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.737
So the information you two have

00:21:20.737 --> 00:21:23.699
is something
that Team Grey needs critically.

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.243
I'll make a deal with them
using that as leverage.

00:21:26.743 --> 00:21:28.996
But what if they don't believe
what we say?

00:21:29.496 --> 00:21:30.789
Look, what's their goal?

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:33.417
Their only goal is
to get rid of those monsters.

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:36.003
I'll tell them you'll both cooperate,
and you will.

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:39.631
Saejin Church and its parasites
will be eradicated.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:41.091
Problem solved!

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:43.468
I'm telling you. I'll protect you!

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:46.054
Okay, fine.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:50.142
If things go wrong,
I'll get you to a safe place,

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.352
even if that means
smuggling you out, okay?

00:21:57.441 --> 00:21:59.109
I have a choice here, right?

00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:02.612
Yes.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.281
Make your choice.

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:08.327
Run away now or help me out this once.

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:16.460
Hey, you punk!

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.339
Do you know why you got betrayed
by your gang and are on the run now?

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:23.216
Because you're a goddamn coward.

00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:24.760
Right?

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:28.055
You said the monsters killed
your younger sister,

00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:31.099
and your older sister became one, right?

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:34.519
Now Su-in,
who saved your life, is about to die.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.897
And you're running away?

00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:40.067
Well, that's who you are,
a goddamn coward.

00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:44.446
You're the kind of bastard
who betrays those who trust you--

00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:45.405
No.

00:22:45.989 --> 00:22:46.990
It's not "betray."

00:22:47.657 --> 00:22:50.285
You just don't have the guts
to trust anyone.

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:53.872
That's why you're always thinking about
how to run away.

00:22:55.082 --> 00:22:56.833
The Mangnani Gang knew that about you.

00:22:56.833 --> 00:22:59.795
That's why you're disposable,
you pathetic bastard.

00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:01.463
That's right.

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:04.508
Fine. Go, then. Go.

00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:08.762
I don't intend to work
with a coward like you to rescue Su-in.

00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:13.642
There's no point in trying to give punks
a chance for a fresh start.

00:23:15.352 --> 00:23:16.186
Go.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.522
Beat it, you asshole!

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.943
If I ever catch you again,
I'll rip you apart, okay?

00:23:24.444 --> 00:23:26.071
That asshole punk.

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:28.865
Fucking dickhole.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.954
Fuck this shit!

00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:39.376
Damn it.

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:42.212
You have a way with words.

00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:45.006
You'd make a great home-shopping host
or politician.

00:23:45.006 --> 00:23:47.217
Don't try to be funny when you're not.

00:23:47.217 --> 00:23:49.719
You're bearable at least
with your fucking mouth shut.

00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:52.055
Okay, then. What's next?

00:23:54.641 --> 00:23:58.145 line:20%
NAMIL POLICE STATION

00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:02.524
<i>Listen carefully.
I'll give you an access card.</i>

00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:04.317
<i>Go up to the second floor with that.</i>

00:24:04.317 --> 00:24:05.402
RESTRICTED AREA

00:24:09.072 --> 00:24:10.073
Put this on.

00:24:10.574 --> 00:24:12.742
At the end of the second-floor hallway,

00:24:12.742 --> 00:24:15.036
there is a temporary locker room
for Team Grey.

00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:18.123
It'll be time for a shift change
by the time we get there.

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:19.541
Go into that locker room,

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:22.252
subdue the guard,
and go in the container instead of him.

00:24:22.752 --> 00:24:23.962
What if they recognize me?

00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:27.466
<i>The task force was formed
less than a month ago.</i>

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.384
<i>They don't know each other that well.</i>

00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:33.555
<i>All you have to do is go in
and act as naturally as you can. Okay?</i>

00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:36.600
LOCKER ROOM

00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:46.818
You can subdue one guy, can't you?

00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:49.821
I'm not a fucking weakling.
Of course I can subdue a cop.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.119
Special forces.

00:24:58.121 --> 00:24:59.080
Who the hell are you?

00:25:00.248 --> 00:25:01.249
I was a marine.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.587
Hey! Who the hell are you?

00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:07.422
How did you get in here?

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:13.512
Hey, I said who the hell are you?

00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:21.770
You little...

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:26.399
Hey. Take this with you.

00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:29.736
- What is this?
- It's pepper spray.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.821
Oh, come on.

00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:33.990
You keep it. Put it away. God.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.368
You've got to be kidding me.

00:25:37.994 --> 00:25:38.828
Take it.

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:41.039
Damn it.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.425
Hey, do you have a size in large?

00:26:15.282 --> 00:26:16.741
<i>ETD in one hour, confirmed.</i>

00:26:28.086 --> 00:26:28.920
Hey.

00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:33.925
God, that freaking bastard.

00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:42.392
<i>Once inside the container,</i>

00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:46.438
<i>find the remote control to disengage
the machine over Su-in's head.</i>

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:47.355
You're late.

00:26:48.023 --> 00:26:51.234
There's nothing special to note.
Just stand by until departure.

00:26:52.193 --> 00:26:53.778
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:27:01.369 --> 00:27:02.370
Wait.

00:27:07.542 --> 00:27:08.627
Did you eat dinner?

00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:10.629
What did they serve?

00:27:15.508 --> 00:27:16.926
Oh, I guess it was good.

00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:19.012
So, what was it?

00:27:24.517 --> 00:27:26.478
Hey, which base are you from?

00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.573
Anyway, dinner was good, right?

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.035
Okay, thank you.

00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:52.754
Okay, we're going to take off
earlier than planned,

00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:54.297
so get ready, everyone.

00:28:03.223 --> 00:28:05.350
I'll take the remote control myself.

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:13.733
One of you should stay with her
and monitor her condition.

00:28:13.733 --> 00:28:17.153
Get inside the container
and travel with her. Understood?

00:28:19.322 --> 00:28:21.157
Now, let's hurry up and get ready.

00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:26.413
What's up? Did you not hear her?
Get in. Hurry up.

00:28:27.747 --> 00:28:28.581
Over here.

00:28:38.758 --> 00:28:40.760
Okay, move quickly.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.886
Come on.

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:44.389
Get ready quickly.

00:28:46.808 --> 00:28:48.435
Oh fuck.

00:28:48.935 --> 00:28:49.894
Damn it.

00:28:50.478 --> 00:28:52.105
Stop!

00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:53.940
Move quickly.

00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:56.192
Yes, it's all good.

00:28:57.444 --> 00:28:58.361
Further back.

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:09.164
<i>All troops, board the vehicles.
Check the radio and stand by.</i>

00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:17.422
Damn it.
I shouldn't have trusted that punk.

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:19.507
Hey, wait.

00:29:19.507 --> 00:29:21.634
- I knew it.
- What are you doing?

00:29:21.634 --> 00:29:26.389
I knew you'd do this, so I informed
the chief that we'll provide support too.

00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:28.767
We should at least let him know.
I did well, right?

00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:31.394
Right. Well done.

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:38.109
Let's go.

00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:55.710
Su-in.

00:29:56.586 --> 00:29:58.505
Heidi, can you at least wake up?

00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:14.479
My goodness, everyone is working so hard.

00:30:24.739 --> 00:30:28.576
Damn, this much manpower
just to transfer one kid.

00:30:28.576 --> 00:30:30.286
This seems like overkill.

00:30:30.286 --> 00:30:31.371
Don't you agree?

00:30:35.917 --> 00:30:37.293
Why are you so tense?

00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:39.879
Me?

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.468
Like you said, we don't know
what'll happen to her once transferred.

00:30:46.302 --> 00:30:47.136
That's why.

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:51.933
By the way,

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.143
you said you go to church.

00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:57.105
What church?

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.069
Why ask all of a sudden?

00:31:03.903 --> 00:31:04.737
What?

00:31:05.613 --> 00:31:07.490
Because it's hilarious, you idiot.

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:10.994
It's not like you're gonna come with me.

00:31:12.662 --> 00:31:13.663
Yeah, you're right.

00:32:08.384 --> 00:32:10.470
Escort vehicle, how's the situation ahead?

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.264
<i>Traffic is congested
from 100 meters ahead.</i>

00:32:14.057 --> 00:32:16.726
Check what's going on but stay vigilant.

00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:19.062
<i>Copy. Two men are moving to the front.</i>

00:32:27.236 --> 00:32:28.279
Why'd we stop?

00:32:32.408 --> 00:32:34.118
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:36.287
- Are they special forces?
- What is it?

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.247
Has there been an accident?

00:32:38.247 --> 00:32:40.124
- What's this?
- What's going on?

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:48.091
<i>Arrived at the scene.</i>

00:32:48.091 --> 00:32:49.008
What is this?

00:32:49.592 --> 00:32:51.761
- There's been an accident.
- What's with him?

00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:55.932
Looks like there's been an accident.

00:33:04.023 --> 00:33:05.692
<i>Emergency!</i>

00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:09.320
<i>Man down! Requesting support!</i>

00:33:17.954 --> 00:33:20.331
<i>We have an injured man!
We're under attack!</i>

00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:21.791
They want the Hunting Dog.

00:33:21.791 --> 00:33:23.292
Turn around and leave.

00:33:23.292 --> 00:33:25.962
<i>Multiple targets identified.
They're among the civilians!</i>

00:33:35.888 --> 00:33:38.474
<i>There are too many citizens
to identify parasites.</i>

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.227
Evacuate!

00:33:41.227 --> 00:33:42.311
- Move to the back!
- Go!

00:33:42.311 --> 00:33:44.188
Move back! Evacuate!

00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:45.189
Damn it.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.025
Evacuate now!

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.319
Evacuate now!

00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:09.881
Hey, we have to evacuate people.

00:34:11.174 --> 00:34:13.801
<i>Multiple parasites identified!
Requesting support!</i>

00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:20.767
What's going on?

00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:24.228
Hey, evacuate the people first.
Goddamn it.

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:25.521
Please get out of the car!

00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:27.273
Come on out!

00:34:27.273 --> 00:34:29.150
Get out of the car! Hurry!

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.069
Move toward the back! Quickly!

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.404
Don't stay in the car! Hurry!

00:35:13.736 --> 00:35:14.987
<i>Agent, do you copy?</i>

00:35:14.987 --> 00:35:17.031
<i>Report the situation! Vehicle hit!</i>

00:35:40.054 --> 00:35:41.305
Damn it!

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.112
Hey, are you okay?

00:35:57.113 --> 00:35:57.947
Jeong Su-in.

00:35:58.656 --> 00:35:59.490
Heidi!

00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:46.704
Who the hell are you, you bastard?

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:50.601
Captain!

00:37:58.359 --> 00:37:59.443
Damn it!

00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:23.092
There have always been people
trying to help you<i>,</i>

00:38:23.092 --> 00:38:25.678
even when you consider yourself a monster.

00:38:30.558 --> 00:38:31.934
Just by acknowledging

00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:36.522
that there are people
who think of them and care for them,

00:38:37.189 --> 00:38:39.108
humans can never be alone.

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.028
You did a good job.

00:38:42.778 --> 00:38:44.447
You're so brave, Su-in.

00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:47.658
You saved yourself, didn't you?

00:39:01.088 --> 00:39:02.256
Hey, let's go home.

00:39:03.132 --> 00:39:04.467
What do I press? This?

00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:05.968
Fuck.

00:39:09.138 --> 00:39:10.056
Damn it, whatever.

00:39:15.144 --> 00:39:16.228
Oh! It worked!

00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:19.231
It's time to go back.

00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:31.160
Hey.

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.043
What?

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:40.920
No time for that. We gotta go.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.254
Get up.

00:39:51.847 --> 00:39:53.182
Hey, stop right there.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.184
Wait. Hold.

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.686
- Sir, I need to check your car.
- What?

00:39:57.686 --> 00:39:59.855
A vehicle has been stolen, you see.

00:40:00.439 --> 00:40:01.649
Please step out of the car.

00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:08.114
Damn it.

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:17.498
Stop!

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:19.792
Stop!

00:40:24.839 --> 00:40:27.716
Captain! Get in quickly! Come on!

00:40:28.217 --> 00:40:29.051
Quickly!

00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:45.359
- That fucking monster was shooting at us.
- Monster?

00:40:46.068 --> 00:40:47.486
What's going on?

00:40:47.486 --> 00:40:49.780
What about Mr. Chul-min? Why was he there?

00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:54.493
Oh, that. He and I came up with a plan
to get you out of there.

00:40:55.077 --> 00:40:56.662
And we are about to succeed.

00:40:57.663 --> 00:41:00.040
You mentioned a monster.
Who are you talking about?

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.961
The bastard next to your cop friend.
He's a monster.

00:41:04.462 --> 00:41:07.214
I saw him killing the monster
in the iron mask.

00:41:07.214 --> 00:41:09.091
I've explained this so many times.

00:41:33.073 --> 00:41:33.949
What the hell?

00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:35.784
What are you doing?

00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:47.213
What? Did they give up?

00:41:47.213 --> 00:41:49.089
Your cop friend must've done something.

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:53.761
There's another monster there.

00:41:53.761 --> 00:41:55.721
- What?
- He's in danger. Pull over!

00:41:55.721 --> 00:41:57.973
- Are you crazy?
- I said pull over!

00:42:06.482 --> 00:42:07.316
Hey!

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:10.528
Shit.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.198
Hey! I did all I could!

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.242
Whatever. Fuck it.

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.005
What are you doing?

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:34.843
Captain, let's stop this now.

00:42:45.938 --> 00:42:48.691
Hey, what the hell are you doing,
you bastard?

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:53.237
Captain.

00:42:56.448 --> 00:42:59.702
As the police,
we chase criminals day in and day out,

00:42:59.702 --> 00:43:02.371
pulling all-nighters, but what do we gain?

00:43:02.371 --> 00:43:03.289
Tell me.

00:43:03.872 --> 00:43:06.959
We get cursed at, beaten, and stabbed.

00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:10.796
And despite our performance,
our fucking salary barely goes up.

00:43:11.463 --> 00:43:15.217
We live a pathetic life,
barely able to afford our kids' tuition.

00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:17.970
Are you out of your fucking mind?

00:43:19.847 --> 00:43:23.017
"If I'd known this from the start,
I would've chosen a different path."

00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:25.019
You always say that, right?

00:43:26.645 --> 00:43:28.606
Well, if an opportunity comes your way,

00:43:29.982 --> 00:43:30.816
seize it.

00:43:33.152 --> 00:43:34.862
Are you still the Won-seok I know?

00:43:36.822 --> 00:43:38.949
You asked me what church I go to.

00:43:42.661 --> 00:43:43.787
I go to Saejin Church.

00:43:53.505 --> 00:43:56.467
Captain, put your gun away
and hear me out.

00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:59.053
Our Saejin Church

00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:01.013
is different.

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:03.349
How should I put it?

00:44:05.184 --> 00:44:07.144
They're much more rational.

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:10.731
They have a clear understanding
of our society. Very objective too.

00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:13.317
They aren't irrational like humans.

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.319
You see, Captain,

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.239
I seized the opportunity
I'd been waiting for

00:44:19.907 --> 00:44:22.076
my entire life.

00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:27.122
You shouldn't miss out either, okay?

00:44:27.122 --> 00:44:28.040
Captain.

00:44:28.957 --> 00:44:32.127
Please trust me just this once.

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:34.630
I don't want to kill you.

00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:36.632
Please trust me.

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:39.426
Is that why you killed the Hunting Dog?

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:24.907
Jeong Su-in!

00:46:25.491 --> 00:46:26.325
Get in quickly!

00:46:39.755 --> 00:46:41.131
Aren't we going after them?

00:46:42.049 --> 00:46:44.176
Seeing it running away like this,

00:46:44.176 --> 00:46:46.637
it is a rational being
that puts survival first.

00:46:48.263 --> 00:46:50.098
It will not be much of a threat.

00:46:54.144 --> 00:46:56.438
Besides, I need to get used to this body.

00:47:05.531 --> 00:47:07.991
It doesn't seem like
there are any more parasites here.

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:10.953
Assess any casualties
and call the forensics.

00:47:20.963 --> 00:47:22.297
Jeong Su-in, are you okay?

00:47:23.423 --> 00:47:24.508
I guess you're Heidi.

00:47:25.384 --> 00:47:26.802
How's Su-in doing right now?

00:47:28.053 --> 00:47:30.305
Su-in needs time right now.

00:47:34.142 --> 00:47:35.352
A lot of time.

00:47:53.287 --> 00:47:55.455
Get changed. You have blood on you.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:30.485
